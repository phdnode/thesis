Therefore, SysML was created. It has been steadily gaining popularity, and many companies, especially in the heavily-regulated Defense, Automotive, Aerospace, Medical Device and Telecomms industries, are already using SysML, or are plannning to switch over to it in the near future. However, little information is currently available on the market regarding SysML. Its use is just on the crest of becoming a widespread phenomenon, and so thousands of software engineers are now beginning to look for training and resources. The proposed book will provide an introduction to SysML, and instruction on how to implement it, for all these new users. *The first available book on SysML in English *Insider information!

The analysis suggests that, except for cases of very shallow spoil removal, bridging is cheaper and ecologically preferable to filled roadway construction.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08920757309361667","DOI":"10.1080/08920757309361667","ISSN":"0090-8339","author":[{"family":"Pope","given":"R.

Re-reading the texts without the prior assumption of idealism allows the more material aspects of Leibniz's metaphysics to emerge. Leibniz is found to advance a synthesis of idealism and materialism. His ontology posits indivisible, living, animal-like corporeal substances as the real metaphysical constituents of the universe; his epistemology combines sense-experience and reason; and his ethics fuses confused perceptions and insensible appetites with distinct perceptions and rational choice. In the light of his sustained commitment to the reality of bodies, Phemister re-examines his dynamics, the doctrine of pre-established harmony and his views on freedom. The image of Leibniz as a rationalist philosopher who values activity and reason over passivity and sense-experience is replaced by the one of a philosopher who recognises that, in the created world, there can only be activity if there is also passivity; minds, souls and forms if there is also matter; good if there is evil; perfection if there is imperfection.","URL":"http://ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/1-4020-3401-6","ISBN":"978-1-4020-3401-5","call-number":"B2598 .P54 2005eb","shortTitle":"Leibniz and the natural world","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Phemister","given":"Pauline"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,3]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/2DTD5MTK","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/2DTD5MTK","type":"chapter","title":"Enmergy in ecosystems","container-title":"Environmental Monographs and Symposia","publisher":"John Wiley","page":"337-369","call-number":"0047","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1986"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/2EQAEUNX","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/2EQAEUNX","type":"article-journal","title":"The Dynamic Interactions among Beliefs, Role Metaphors, and Teaching Practices: A Case Study of Teacher Change.","container-title":"Science Education","page":"185-99","volume":"75","issue":"2","source":"ERIC","ISSN":"ISSN-0036-8326","call-number":"0160","shortTitle":"The Dynamic Interactions among Beliefs, Role Metaphors, and Teaching Practices","journalAbbreviation":"Science Education","author":[{"family":"Briscoe","given":"Carol"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1991"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/2F3MRZJ4","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/2F3MRZJ4","type":"book","title":"Perl best practices","publisher":"O'Reilly","publisher-place":"Sebastopol  CA","edition":"1st ed.","event-place":"Sebastopol  CA","ISBN":"978-0-596-00173-5","author":[{"family":"Conway","given":"Damian"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/2G5Z9E37","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/2G5Z9E37","type":"book","title":"The Tools of Regulation","publisher":"Federation Press","source":"arrow.monash.edu.au","abstract":"1 ed.","URL":"http://arrow.monash.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/monash:68361","ISBN":"978-1-86287-802-0","language":"eng","author":[{"family":"Freiberg","given":"Arie"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,7]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/2GIACRDH","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/2GIACRDH","type":"article-journal","title":"Universally valid reformulation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle on noise and disturbance in measurement","container-title":"Physical Review A","page":"042105","volume":"67","issue":"4","source":"APS","abstract":"The Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that the product of the noise in a position measurement and the momentum disturbance caused by that measurement should be no less than the limit set by Planck’s constant ħ/2 as demonstrated by Heisenberg’s thought experiment using a γ-ray microscope. Here it is shown that this common assumption is not universally true: a universally valid trade-off relation between the noise and the disturbance has an additional correlation term, which is redundant when the intervention brought by the measurement is independent of the measured object, but which allows the noise-disturbance product much below Planck’s constant when the intervention is dependent. A model of measuring interaction with dependent intervention shows that Heisenberg’s lower bound for the noise-disturbance product is violated even by a nearly nondisturbing precise position measurement. An experimental implementation is also proposed to realize the above model in the context of optical quadrature measurement with currently available linear optical devices.","URL":"http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.67.042105","DOI":"10.1103/PhysRevA.67.042105","journalAbbreviation":"Phys.

The aim has been to ascertain what soil sampling guidelines exist in Europe; to detect similarities and differences (comparable results), advantages and deficiencies; to identify incompatible strategies and evaluate how methodologies might affect data quality; to investigate sources of deviations or uncertainties; to improve comparability and representativeness of soil sampling; to investigate the need for harmonised sampling guidelines; and to develop suggestions for standard operating procedures (SOP). Soil sampling guidelines throughout Europe differ as to whether they are applied by law, or used throughout the country. In some countries these are ISO/DIS related or based (ISO 10381-1, 1995; ISO 10381-2, 1995), or are produced by a scientific society or a standardisation body. As far as sampling strategy is concerned, not all sampling guidelines clearly describe the sampling scale, the specifications for contamination risk precautions, the sampling plan and protocol structure and the pre-analysis treatment of the soil samples. The purpose for sampling, in descending order of frequency, is soil pollution, soil fertilisation, general soil monitoring, background risk assessment, or else it is not specified. The majority of countries do not sample the top organic matter separately. Sampling depth is either related to the morphogenetic horizon or to ad hoc sampling depth, which is not specified in all cases. They suggest mass- and volume-related soil sampling, while the sampling pattern is not presented in all national guidelines. The criteria for area, site, unit, sub-unit, and point selection are mainly based on pedology and land use, following the history and pre-screening information or geology, or is site related. Some guidelines suggest the division of sampling units into sub-units. The sampling pattern is mainly grid sampling, grid and random sampling, or not mentioned. Sampling density inside the sampling unit either varies greatly or it is not mentioned, while the size of the sampling unit varies widely. Most guidelines require the collection of composite instead of simple samples, while some prefer sampling soil profiles. In the European SSG many technical details and steps are either not defined or vary, while in the pre-analysis treatment quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) approaches are used either both in the lab and in the field, or only in the field, or are not mentioned. The common points and the points in which harmonisation could be started or achieved are discussed.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969700006112","DOI":"10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00611-2","ISSN":"0048-9697","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","author":[{"family":"Theocharopoulos","given":"S.

However, the load that this takes off human shoulders has to be carried elsewhere, and the Earth has borne the burden. Many of us woke up to the environmental cost when over a century of industrialization finally surpassed the capacity of nature to assimilate it. International in scope, Heavy Metals in the Environment: Using Wetlands for Their Removal discusses wetland functions and heavy metal contamination. It addresses such questions as: Can systems powered by sunlight handle toxins more effectively than systems running on fossil fuel? At what scale and by what means do we define efficiency? These questions resonate increasingly with a number of global challenges. As inescapable as climate change, you can no longer avoid airborne toxins, acid rain, and polluted water by moving away from them. When the time comes to rely less on fossil fuel-based technology, how will we clean up the aftermath of toxic misadventures? Written by a leader in the growing field of ecological engineering, Heavy Metals in the Environment: Using Wetlands for Their Removal presents scientific studies that illustrate how natural systems use wetlands to adapt to changes in the ecosystem. It focuses primarily on lead, one of the first materials used by developing civilizations and a metal used heavily in the industrial era. The goal: to achieve a better understanding of how natural systems use wetlands to adapt to wastes.","ISBN":"978-1-56670-401-4","shortTitle":"Heavy metals in the environment","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard Thomas"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/37R5Q3T7","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/37R5Q3T7","type":"article-journal","title":"The Fracking Revolution: Shale Gas as a Case Study in Innovation Policy","container-title":"Emory Law Journal","volume":"64","issue":"3","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=2548080","shortTitle":"The Fracking Revolution","author":[{"family":"Golden","given":"John M."},{"family":"Wiseman","given":"Hannah Jacobs"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,4]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/3BFVH787","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/3BFVH787","type":"article-journal","title":"Bilirubin injury to neurons: Contribution of oxidative stress and rescue by glycoursodeoxycholic acid","container-title":"NeuroToxicology","page":"259-269","volume":"29","issue":"2","abstract":"It is well established that high levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) can be toxic to the central nervous system, and oxidative stress is emerging as a relevant event in the mechanisms of UCB encephalopathy. In contrast, the hydrophilic bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), has been reported as a cytoprotective and antioxidant molecule. In this study, we investigated if exposure of rat neurons in primary culture to clinically relevant concentrations of UCB leads to oxidative injury. The contribution of oxidative stress in UCB neurotoxicity was further investigated by examining whether the reduction of NO production by NAME, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, prevents the disruption of the redox status and neuronal damage. Moreover, we evaluated the ability of glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), the most relevant conjugated derivative in the serum of patients treated with UDCA, to abrogate the UCB-induced oxidative damage. Cultured rat neurons were incubated with 50 or 100 μM UCB in the presence of 100 μM human serum albumin, alone or in combination with 100 μM NAME or with 50 μM GUDCA, for 4 h at 37 °C. Protein carbonyls, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-protein adducts, intracellular glutathione content and cell death were determined. The results obtained showed that UCB induces protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation, while diminishes the thiol antioxidant defences, events that were correlated with the extent of cell death. Moreover, these events were counteracted by NAME and abrogated in the presence of GUDCA. Collectively, this study shows that oxidative stress is one of the pathways associated with neuronal viability impairment by UCB, and that GUDCA significantly prevents such effects from occurring. These findings corroborate the antioxidant properties of the bile acid and point to a new therapeutic approach for UCB-induced neurotoxicity due to oxidative stress.

We focused on two prominent principles—the maximum power principle (MPP) and the maximum entropy production principle (MEPP)—and the literature that applies to both. Although these principles have conceptual overlap, we found considerable differences in their historical development, the disciplines that apply these principles, and their adoption in the literature. These principles were more similar than dissimilar, and the maximization of power in ecosystems occurs with maximum entropy production. These principles have great potential to explain how systems develop, organize, and function, but there are no widely agreed-on theoretical derivations for the MEPP and MPP, hindering their broader use in ecological research.

Ecological systems are closely interrelated (in a landscape and in the biosphere) and with human systems, such as urban systems or, generically, economic systems. These relations have been summarized and measured by the concept of ecosystem services and the definition of socio-ecological systems. In order to detect ecosystem properties and dynamics in this context, it is recommended to use “super-holistic” indicators, e.g. thermodynamic indicators such as emergy and eco-exergy. Emergy accounts for energy and matter inputs converging to a system, while eco-exergy is a state-based descriptor of a system's structure based on biomass and genetic information. The characteristics of a generic ecosystem can be described by the relationship among the three orientors – emergy, eco-exergy, ecosystem services – making it clear that inputs are used up, directly or indirectly, to create and maintain a given system state and/or to produce services in output. This paper presents an input-state-output description of ecosystems in a socio-ecological context which leads to a characterization in 8 categories, in order to provide a new contribution to systems ecology.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380013001348","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.02.031","ISSN":"0304-3800","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Coscieme","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Pulselli","given":"Federico M."},{"family":"Jørgensen","given":"Sven E."},{"family":"Bastianoni","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Marchettini","given":"Nadia"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",6,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,9]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/3XKRTFGP","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/3XKRTFGP","type":"article-journal","title":"A scaling method for priorities in hierarchical structures","container-title":"Journal of Mathematical Psychology","page":"234-281","volume":"15","issue":"3","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate a method of scaling ratios using the principal eigenvector of a positive pairwise comparison matrix. Consistency of the matrix data is defined and measured by an expression involving the average of the nonprincipal eigenvalues. We show that λmax = n is a necessary and sufficient condition for consistency. We also show that twice this measure is the variance in judgmental errors. A scale of numbers from 1 to 9 is introduced together with a discussion of how it compares with other scales. To illustrate the theory, it is then applied to some examples for which the answer is known, offering the opportunity for validating the approach. The discussion is then extended to multiple criterion decision making by formally introducing the notion of a hierarchy, investigating some properties of hierarchies, and applying the eigenvalue approach to scaling complex problems structured hierarchically to obtain a unidimensional composite vector for scaling the elements falling in any single level of the hierarchy. A brief discussion is also included regarding how the hierarchy serves as a useful tool for decomposing a large-scale problem, in order to make measurement possible despite the now-classical observation that the mind is limited to 7 ± 2 factors for simultaneous comparison.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022249677900335","DOI":"10.1016/0022-2496(77)90033-5","ISSN":"0022-2496","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Mathematical Psychology","author":[{"family":"Saaty","given":"Thomas L"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1977",6,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,15]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/3Z3MG2HJ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/3Z3MG2HJ","type":"article-journal","title":"How the Brain Gives Rise to Mathematics in Ontogeny and in Culture","container-title":"Journal of Mind and Behavior","page":"343-349","volume":"15","issue":"4","source":"ProQuest","abstract":"Within the framework of Neurological Positivism (NP) this article describes how brain algorithms are translated into mathematics in ontogeny and in culture.

It is proposed that self- referencing feedback processes of maximum-power evolution guide the construction of algorithmic isomorphies between preadapted brain algorithms and mathematics. It is concluded that maximum- power evolution as described in NP offers mechanisms that make sense of findings that suggest that mathematical axioms are innate, yet not directly the result of selection as traditionally understood.

Protogaea also includes a series of engraved plates depicting the remains of animals—in particular the famous reconstruction of a “fossil unicorn”—together with a cross section of the cave in which some fossil objects were discovered. Though the works of Leibniz have been widely translated, Protogaea has languished in its original Latin for centuries. Now Claudine Cohen and Andre Wakefield offer the first English translation of this central text in natural philosophy and natural history. Written between 1691 and 1693, and first published after Leibniz’s death in 1749, Protogaea reemerges in this bilingual edition with an introduction that carefully situates the work within its historical context.","ISBN":"978-0-226-11297-8","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Leibniz","given":"Gottfried Wilhelm"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",9,15]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4C8BSS9D","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4C8BSS9D","type":"article-newspaper","title":"Dr Scienceman's brave new word","container-title":"The Australian Newspaper","page":"7","call-number":"0000","author":[{"family":"Cadzow","given":"J"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1984",5,15]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4CISIRBB","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4CISIRBB","type":"article-journal","title":"Thermodynamic basis of the principle of least action","container-title":"Soviet Physics Journal","page":"426–431","volume":"34","issue":"5","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00897404","author":[{"family":"Maslov","given":"V.

NASA's objective is to better understand and effectively manage risk, and thus more effectively ensure mission and programmatic success, and to achieve and maintain high safety standards at NASA. NASA intends to use risk assessment in its programs and projects to support optimal management decision making for the improvement of safety and program performance. In addition to using quantitative/probabilistic risk assessment to improve safety and enhance the safety decision process, NASA has incorporated quantitative risk assessment into its system safety assessment process, which until now has relied primarily on a qualitative representation of risk. Also, NASA has recently adopted the Risk-Informed Decision Making  process [1-1] as a valuable addition to supplement existing deterministic and experience-based engineering methods and tools. Over the years, NASA has been a leader in most of the technologies it has employed in its programs. One would think that PRA should be no exception. In fact, it would be natural for NASA to be a leader in PRA because, as a technology pioneer, NASA uses risk assessment and management implicitly or explicitly on a daily basis. NASA has probabilistic safety requirements  for crew transportation system missions to the International Space Station  [1-2]. NASA intends to have probabilistic requirements for any new human spaceflight transportation system acquisition. Methods to perform risk and reliability assessment in the early 1960s originated in U.S. aerospace and missile programs. Fault tree analysis  is an example. It would have been a reasonable extrapolation to expect that NASA would also become the world leader in the application of PRA. That was, however, not to happen. Early in the Apollo program, estimates of the probability for a successful roundtrip human mission to the moon yielded disappointingly low  values and NASA became discouraged from further performing quantitative risk analyses until some two decades later when the methods were more refined, rigorous, and repeatable. Instead, NASA decided to rely primarily on the Hazard Analysis  and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis  methods for system safety assessment.","URL":"http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20120001369","author":[{"family":"Stamatelatos,Michael","given":""},{"family":"Dezfuli","given":"Homayoon"},{"family":"Apostolakis","given":"George"},{"family":"Everline","given":"Chester"},{"family":"Guarro","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Mathias","given":"Donovan"},{"family":"Mosleh","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Paulos","given":"Todd"},{"family":"Riha","given":"David"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Curtis"},{"family":"Vesely","given":"William"},{"family":"Youngblood","given":"Robert"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4MA73MDV","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4MA73MDV","type":"book","title":"Systems analysis and simulation in ecology","publisher":"Elsevier","volume":"3","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lfggBQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Systems+Analysis+and+Simulation+in+Ecology&ots=iursokER66&sig=piUB_zyVGFT47_jfU18PQyvIKCs","author":[{"family":"Patten","given":"Bernard C."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,4]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4MKB77BV","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4MKB77BV","type":"book","title":"Energy systems overview of the Amazon basin","publisher":"Centre for Wetland, Univeristy of Florida","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard T."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Mark T."},{"family":"Christianson","given":"Robert A."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1986"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4MSN6SXH","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4MSN6SXH","type":"article-journal","title":"Getting Serious with JavaScript","container-title":"WebGL Insights","page":"49","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6crECQAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA49&dq=Getting+Serious+with+JavaScript.+Matthew+Amato+and+Kevin+Ring&ots=Jq8hbWMdUB&sig=UM6JlanN7f_OT9DZM5zJ5ZwZCAI","author":[{"family":"Amato","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Ring","given":"Kevin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4N2I2AA6","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4N2I2AA6","type":"article-journal","title":"Assessment and management of risk in subsurface hydrology: A review and perspective","container-title":"Advances in Water Resources","collection-title":"35th Year Anniversary Issue","page":"247-260","volume":"51","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"Uncertainty plagues every effort to model subsurface processes and every decision made on the basis of such models.

The article explains this apparent contradiction by looking at the case of Shell in Nigeria. Nigeria experiences serious political instability, yet Shell is expanding its investment in the country. This article deals with sources of firm-specific political instability that have affected Shell in Nigeria in the past and attempts to explain why a specific corporation such as Shell may want to make investments in the country despite political instability. The examination of three different angles of Shell's activity, which forms the core of this paper, reveals that political instability does not hinder Shell from operating in Nigeria. Firstly, the international perspective illuminates in what way Nigeria may be more attractive to Shell than other countries. Profits in Nigeria appear to be higher than elsewhere, while Shell occupies a dominant market position unrivalled in most other countries. Secondly, the structural perspective illuminates the interconnectedness of Shell with state structures in Nigeria that may tie the company to Nigeria. Shell established a first mover advantage in the 1950s, since Nigeria was a British colony until 1960 and British oil companies were given preferential treatment. After independence, Shell managed to penetrate state structures which helped to hedge political risk in the country. Thirdly, the strategic perspective explores how Shell's strategic approaches may make political instability less significant to Shell. This article concludes that Shell has adopted to political instability. The conclusion that political instability can be conducive to business is significant since one expects political instability to be inherently harmful to business.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01436599814343","DOI":"10.1080/01436599814343","ISSN":"0143-6597","shortTitle":"Political instability and business","author":[{"family":"Frynas","given":"Jedrzej George"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",9,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4P5MRJDZ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4P5MRJDZ","type":"webpage","title":"Gas and Oil in Unconventional Reservoirs in the South East of South Australia FAQ","abstract":"Gas and Oil in Unconventional Reservoirs in the South East of South Australia FAQ Last updated: 02 Jun 2015","URL":"http://www.petroleum.statedevelopment.sa.gov.au/prospectivity/basin_and_province_information/unconventional_gas/frequently_asked_questions/south_east_unconventional_gas_faq#10","author":[{"family":"SA","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,13]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4QBVP6QI","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4QBVP6QI","type":"article-journal","title":"Is the universe leaking energy?","container-title":"Scientific American","page":"38–47","volume":"303","issue":"1","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v303/n1/full/scientificamerican0710-38.html","author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Tamara M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,24]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4QZGIR5W","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4QZGIR5W","type":"article-journal","title":"Probabilistic risk analysis in subsurface hydrology","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"34","issue":"5","source":"CrossRef","URL":"http://doi.wiley.com/10.1029/2007GL029245","DOI":"10.1029/2007GL029245","ISSN":"0094-8276","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Tartakovsky","given":"Daniel M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",3,15]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,13]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4QZS2B7R","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/4QZS2B7R","type":"article-journal","title":"Avoidable Fraccident: An Argument against Strict Liability for Hydraulic Fracturing","container-title":"University of Kansas Law Review","page":"1215","volume":"60","URL":"http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ukalr60&id=1225&div=&collection=journals","shortTitle":"Avoidable Fraccident","journalAbbreviation":"U.

This is achieved by investigating the Italian transportation system by means of four different evaluation methods: material flow accounting (MFA), embodied energy analysis (EEA), exergy analysis (EXA) and emergy synthesis (ES). The case study is the main Italian transportation infrastructure, composed by highways, railways, and high-speed railways (high-speed trains, HST) sub-systems supporting both passengers and freight transport. All the analyses have been performed based on a common database of material, labor, energy and fuel input flows used in the construction, maintenance and yearly use of roads, railways and vehicles. Specific matter and energy intensities of both passenger and freight transportation services were calculated factors affecting results as well as strength and weakness points of each transportation modality were also stressed. Results pointed out that the most important factors in determining the acceptability of a transportation system are not only the specific fuel consumption and the energy and material costs of vehicles, as it is common belief, but also the energy and material costs for infrastructure construction as well as its intensity of use (with special focus on load factor of vehicles). The latter become the dominant factors in HST modality, due to technological and safety reasons that require high energy-cost materials and low intensity of traffic. This translates into very high thermodynamic and environmental costs for passenger and freight transported, among which an embodied energy demand up to 1.44�MJ/p-km and 3.09�MJ/t-km, respectively.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V2S-4S094WB-2/1/18a05082957327c412c018b9e75b40c6","DOI":"10.1016/j.energy.2008.01.010","call-number":"0003","author":[{"family":"Federici","given":"M."},{"family":"Ulgiati","given":"S."},{"family":"Basosi","given":"R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",5,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/57T6735R","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/57T6735R","type":"book","title":"Models Of Nature: Ecology, Conservation, and Cultural Revolution in Soviet Russia","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","call-number":"0050","shortTitle":"Models Of Nature","author":[{"family":"Weiner","given":"D.

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.","DOI":"10.1109/TVCG.2011.185","ISSN":"1077-2626","author":[{"family":"Bostock","given":"M."},{"family":"Ogievetsky","given":"V."},{"family":"Heer","given":"J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/59RR5V4I","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/59RR5V4I","type":"book","title":"Transboundary risk governance","collection-title":"Earthscan risk and society series","publisher":"Earthscan","publisher-place":"Sterling, VA","number-of-pages":"1 online resource ( xvii, 155 p.)","source":"UQ Library Search, Summon 2.0","event-place":"Sterling, VA","URL":"http://www.UQL.eblib.com.AU/EBLWeb/patron/?target=patron&extendedid=P_483774","ISBN":"978-1-84977-464-2","call-number":"GE190.B29","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Lidskog","given":"Rolf"},{"family":"Soneryd","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Uggla","given":"Ylva"},{"literal":"Ebooks Corporation"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,7]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5BITTW9B","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5BITTW9B","type":"book","title":"Unity Through Diversity: A Festschrift for Ludwig Von Bertalanffy","publisher":"Gordon and Breach Science Publishers","call-number":"0008","shortTitle":"Unity Through Diversity","author":[{"family":"Bertalanffy","given":"L.","non-dropping-particle":"von"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1973"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5CDSUEV2","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5CDSUEV2","type":"article","title":"Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework","publisher":"The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission","URL":"http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~andrewc/erm2/reading/ERM%20-%20COSO%20Application%20Techniques.pdf","language":"English","author":[{"family":"COSO","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,26]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5CEIKMP9","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5CEIKMP9","type":"article","title":"UMLTM for Systems Engineering","publisher":"Object Management Group","abstract":"Request For Proposal","URL":"http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?ad/03-03-41.pdf","call-number":"0000","author":[{"family":"OMG","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5CT8WA2G","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5CT8WA2G","type":"book","title":"Feynman lectures on computation","publisher":"Penguin","publisher-place":"London","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-14-028451-5","author":[{"family":"Feynman","given":"Richard"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5D6GZRAC","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5D6GZRAC","type":"webpage","title":"MMSD – final report","container-title":"International Institute for Environment and Development","abstract":"Presenting the principal conclusions of the IIED/WBCSD project Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development (MMSD) - the most ambitious study yet undertaken on the role of minerals in sustainable development.

Its communication, however, has always presented several problems, since it does not follow the same rules of conservation as other energy-based approaches. Attempts have been made to clarify emergy by means of more formal/mathematical approaches, but the problem persists. In this paper, we have introduced a view of emergy and of its algebra based on ingenuous set theory. By means of this simple tool, emergy can be defined as the set of solar exergy that is directly and indirectly necessary to make a product. The operation that correctly sums the emergy “carried” by the inputs to a process is the union. This definition and the operation of union are able to account for all the rules of emergy algebra.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380011002936","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.05.013","ISSN":"0304-3800","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Bastianoni","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Morandi","given":"Fabiana"},{"family":"Flaminio","given":"Tommaso"},{"family":"Pulselli","given":"Riccardo M."},{"family":"Tiezzi","given":"Elisa B.

The Revision Control System (RCS) is a software tool that assists with that task. RCS manages revisions of text documents, in particular source programs, documentation, and test data. It automates the storing, retrieval, logging and identification of revisions, and it provides selection mechanisms for composing configurations. This paper introduces basic version control concepts and discusses the practice of version control using RCS. For conserving space, RCS stores deltas, i.e., differences between successive revisions.

It usually consists of three core areas: analysis, evaluation and control. One of the vital decisions to be made within the area of risk analysis is the choice of techniques to be used which are broadly classified under qualitative and quantitative methods. Through a questionnaire, this paper identifies the most successful risk analysis techniques within both categories. Over one hundred large companies within the construction industry, and every oil and gas operator in the UK were approached. The areas surveyed on were: risk analysis techniques employed by the companies; the relative success of the techniques; the size and range of activities of the company and the company's policy on identifying and responding to specific risks encountered during any particular project. The main conclusions are that personal and corporate experience, and engineering judgement are the most successful qualitative techniques; scenario analysis, EMV, ENPV, and break-even analysis being the principal quantitative techniques.","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3010665","DOI":"10.2307/3010665","ISSN":"0160-5682","journalAbbreviation":"The Journal of the Operational Research Society","author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"S."},{"family":"Ponniah","given":"D."},{"family":"Smith","given":"S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",6,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5PFX8TZX","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5PFX8TZX","type":"book","title":"Fault tree handbook with aerospace applications","publisher":"Office of safety and mission assurance NASA headquarters","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Stamatelatos","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Caraballo","given":"José"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5PJD49QZ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5PJD49QZ","type":"book","title":"Whose justice?

One of the supporting reasons for the elimination of this line was the problem that arose in practice concerning the link between root definitions and conceptual models, constantly encountered during the 25 years in which SSM has been used and developed. The relationship between root definitions and conceptual models was taken to be based only on an instrumental �logic�. Here it is argued that root definitions define and induce dispositions. The dispositions root definitions define are expressed in terms of conceptual models, while the dispositions they induce are the source of the effects they have on the problem-solving practice. In this way, the sole dependency on instrumental logic as the link between the two is loosened, allowing different forms of relationship between the two to emerge, including ones linked more closely to the evolving content of a systems study. � 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1743(199705/06)14:3<153::AID-SRES134>3.0.CO;2-H","DOI":"10.1002/(SICI)1099-1743(199705/06)14:3<153::AID-SRES134>3.0.CO;2-H","call-number":"0030","shortTitle":"Reflecting on SSM","author":[{"family":"Checkland","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Tsouvalis","given":"Costas"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",5,20]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5RFMRKCK","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5RFMRKCK","type":"article-journal","title":"Editorial","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","collection-title":"Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics in Ecology","page":"2867-2868","volume":"222","issue":"16","source":"ScienceDirect","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380011002900","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.05.010","ISSN":"0304-3800","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Jorgensen","given":"Sven Erik"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",8,24]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,4]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5RGR36QI","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5RGR36QI","type":"book","title":"Programming Android","publisher":"O'Reilly Media","number-of-pages":"502","edition":"1","source":"Amazon.com","ISBN":"1-4493-8969-4","author":[{"family":"Mednieks","given":"Zigurd"},{"family":"Dornin","given":"Laird"},{"family":"Meike","given":"G.

Within planning literature, discussion has centred on the value of social media as a tool for community participation. This paper explores the use of social media by a community group in their opposition to a large urban regeneration project – the North Ryde Station Urban Activation Precinct – in Sydney's north-western suburbs. Utilising the research technique of sentiment analysis, a picture of the community group's activities can be captured, including the community's self-organisation, information distribution, recruitment, analysis of issues and sentiment at different times during master planning process. In this instance, the community group is led by a small number of people, while the majority has a low-participation rate. The community group takes a generally positive approach to distributing information and motivating local residents to get involved in the opposition of the master plan.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07293682.2015.1019755","DOI":"10.1080/07293682.2015.1019755","ISSN":"0729-3682","author":[{"family":"Williamson","given":"Wayne"},{"family":"Ruming","given":"Kristian"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,25]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5SJKKZVJ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5SJKKZVJ","type":"article","title":"Coal Seam"}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5T5B7FRW","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5T5B7FRW","type":"book","title":"Report of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Aboriginal Tribes, (British settlements.)","publisher":"London, Pub. for the Society by W.

By using new concepts for measuring the quality of energy, one can express the work of ecosystems and human economies in equivalent terms. From energy models and new energy quality evaluations, one can learn what kinds of coastal systems maximize power, are competitive, economically vital, and likely to have a survival advantage. Energy analysis and synthesis is aided by energy circuit diagrams. Models of the coastal zone that emphasize the change in external driving functions related to world energy sources provide insights and some predictive abilities that are not found in economic studies, since money flows alone do not evaluate external driving energies.This paper suggests four procedures for coastal planning: 1) calculation of investment ratio in units of equal quality to determine which projects are economic in a broad sense, 2) development of energy signatures for coastal ecosystems, 3) determination of which interface ecosystems develop the best energy flows, and 4) development of regional models that include the main features of human and natural ecosystems.","URL":"http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/article/10.1007/BF01865858","DOI":"10.1007/BF01865858","ISSN":"0364-152X, 1432-1009","journalAbbreviation":"Environmental Management","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard T."},{"family":"Kemp","given":"W."},{"family":"Sell","given":"Maurice"},{"family":"Boynton","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Lehman","given":"M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1977",7]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,14]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5WNMR3IA","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5WNMR3IA","type":"article-journal","title":"Leibniz' Scheitern im Oberharzer Silberbergbau – neu betrachtet, insbesondere unter klimatischen Gesichtspunkten","container-title":"Studia Leibnitiana","page":"186-207","volume":"42","issue":"2","source":"JSTOR","abstract":"Besides the well-known difficulties with the Harz miners Leibniz encountered a series of other unfavourable circumstances. It is generally known that Leibniz was active in the Harz silver mining district in the so-called „Little Ice Age”. Less known is that both phases of his activities 1680-1685/86 (essentially trials to introduce windmills for pumping the water out of the mines) and 1692-1695 (experiments to improve the shaft hoisting system) coincided just with the coldest years in central Europe: for example in the 17th century Lake Constance was only totally frozen twice: 1684 and 1695. Concerning the wind regime there are no indications that they were fundamentally different from the ones today. Leibniz did not have available quantitative meteorological observations. Today we know the relation of the average wind speed at the coast, where Leibniz had observed windmills in Holland, and in the Harz mountains. Taking into account that the wind energy is a function of the cube of the wind speed Leibniz had only 40% of the wind energy of the coast available in the Harz. Other unfortunate circumstances which contributed to Leibniz' failure in the Harz mining district were: an agreement favourable for Leibniz, but one that from the outset set the miners against him; after 156 years of driving a dewatering tunnel the fact that the tunnel connected with a favourably located mine just in the moment when Leibniz wanted to started his pumping experiments there using a wind mill; the absence of perpendicular shafts common today and his inability to convince the miners of his ideas and to build a team.","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41698260","ISSN":"0039-3185","journalAbbreviation":"Studia Leibnitiana","author":[{"family":"WELLMER","given":"FRIEDRICH-WILHELM"},{"family":"GOTTSCHALK","given":"JÜRGEN"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,25]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5WS7BC7Q","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5WS7BC7Q","type":"article","title":"Activity 1: Chemistry, origins and hydrogeology of coal","publisher":"Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Mines","abstract":"Activity 1: Chemistry, origins and hydrogeology of coal","URL":"https://www.dnrm.qld.gov.au/water/catchments-planning/healthy-headwaters/coal-seam-gas-water-feasibility-study/activity-1","shortTitle":"Activity 1","language":"en-AU","author":[{"family":"DNRM","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,6]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5XPJB9IQ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/5XPJB9IQ","type":"article-journal","title":"Obsessions, responsibility and guilt: two case reports suggesting a common and specific aetiology","container-title":"Behaviour Research and Therapy","page":"143-145","volume":"32","issue":"1","abstract":"Inflated responsibility, guilt and the psychological fusion of thought and action feature prominently in contemporary accounts of obsessional phenomena.

Manuscripts one and four have been published, manuscript three has been accepted for publication, and manuscripts two and five are currently in review for publication. The   theory  sections contains the first two manuscripts.                 The first manuscript is a review of the literature on Energy Return on Investment (EROI) analysis. I cover five areas in this manuscript, including: (1) EROI and corn ethanol, (2) EROI for most major fuels, (3) alternative EROI applications, (4) EROI and the economy, and (5) the minimum EROI for society.                 The second manuscript provides a methodological framework for performing EROI analysis. I cover the following areas in this manuscript: (1) boundaries of analysis, (2) energy quality corrections, (3) energy intensity values, and lastly (4) alternative EROI statistics.                 The applications  section contains manuscripts three through five. The third manuscript provides a biophysical model of economic growth indicating that the feedback mechanisms between oil supply and oil price have created a growth paradox: maintaining business as usual economic growth will require the production of new sources of oil, yet the only sources of oil remaining require high oil prices, thus hampering economic growth.                 The fourth manuscript is a study on the geographic variability of corn ethanol production. The main conclusions of this study were: (1) the statistical error associated with calculating the EROI of corn ethanol was enough to cast doubt as to whether corn ethanol yields net energy, and (2) failure to account for the geographic variation in corn yields and fertilizer inputs artificially inflated previous estimates of the EROI or corn ethanol.                 In the fifth manuscript I measure the impact of the Urban Heat Island within the metropolitan area of San Juan, Puerto Rico, on the electricity demand within the city.

To answer this question, we explore the way energy and material resources of different quality flow through ecosystems and support, directly and indirectly, ecosystems growth and development. Processes of resource transformation throughout the ecosystem build order, cycle materials, generate and sustain information. Energy drives all these processes and energetic principles explain much of what is observed, including energy degradation according to the laws of thermodynamics. Emergy, a quantitative measure of the global environmental work supporting ecosystem dynamics, is used here in order to provide a deeper understanding of complexity growth and decline in ecosystems. Ecosystem complexity is discussed in this paper in relation to changes in structure, organization and functional capacity, as explained by changes in emergy, empower, and transformity.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6X3D-4P5R60M-2/1/bdf3c68acacf233045daf664874de2c0","DOI":"10.1016/j.cnsns.2007.05.028","call-number":"0006","author":[{"family":"Ulgiati","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Mark T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,29]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/6N5H2M86","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/6N5H2M86","type":"book","title":"The individual and the cosmos in Renaissance philosophy","publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press","publisher-place":"Philadelphia  Pa.","event-place":"Philadelphia  Pa.","ISBN":"978-0-8122-1036-1","call-number":"0234","author":[{"family":"Cassirer","given":"Ernst"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1972"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/6NKWP9BS","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/6NKWP9BS","type":"article-journal","title":"Vandervert's solution to the mind-body problem: A response to vandervert","container-title":"New Ideas in Psychology","page":"129-134","volume":"13","issue":"2","source":"ScienceDirect","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0732118X94000488","DOI":"10.1016/0732-118X(94)00048-8","ISSN":"0732-118X","shortTitle":"Vandervert's solution to the mind-body problem","journalAbbreviation":"New Ideas in Psychology","author":[{"family":"Newman","given":"David"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",7]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,19]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/6RSCJHEN","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/6RSCJHEN","type":"article-journal","title":"The mechanical career of Councillor Orffyreus, confidence man","container-title":"American Journal of Physics","page":"421-427","volume":"81","issue":"6","source":"scitation.aip.org","abstract":"In the early 18th century, J.

Among Bessler&apos;s defenders were Gottfried Leibniz, Johann Bernoulli, Professor Willem &apos;s Gravesande of Leiden University (who wrote to Isaac Newton on the subject), and Prince Karl, ruler of the German state of Hesse-Kassel.

The misinterpretation partially stems from a misconstruction of Nietzsche’s perspectivism, and leads to a conception of self-overcoming that is inconsistent with Nietzsche’s educational ideals. To show this, I examine some of the prominent features of the so-called “debate” of the 1980s surrounding Nietzsche’s conception of self-overcoming. I then offer an alternative conception that is more consistent with Nietzsche’s thought, and provides a more nuanced understanding of Nietzsche’s “anti-democratic” pedagogy. Ultimately, I argue that while Nietzsche’s educational philosophy is not egalitarian, it can be effectively utilized in “democratic” classrooms, assuming his concept of self-overcoming is properly construed.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11217-008-9107-1","DOI":"10.1007/s11217-008-9107-1","ISSN":"0039-3746, 1573-191X","shortTitle":"A (R)evaluation of Nietzsche’s Anti-democratic Pedagogy","journalAbbreviation":"Stud Philos Educ","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Jonas","given":"Mark E."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",4,9]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,29]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/76S8P3JX","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/76S8P3JX","type":"paper-conference","title":"The use of a network energy simulator to synthesize systems and develop analogous theory: the ecosystem example","container-title":"Proceedings of the Cullowhee Conference on Training in Biomathematics","source":"Google Scholar","shortTitle":"The use of a network energy simulator to synthesize systems and develop analogous theory","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"H.

This revolutionary model for collaborative software development is being embraced and studied by many of the biggest players in the high-tech industry, from Sun Microsystems to IBM to Intel. The Cathedral & the Bazaaris a must for anyone who cares about the future of the computer industry or the dynamics of the information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied, debated, and implemented for years to come.

This revised and expanded hardback edition includes new material on open source developments in 1999 and 2000.

Since the 1990s, when Odum's system theories and emergy approach were introduced to China, a great attention was paid to them, since they appeared to Chinese scholars very important, comprehensive, and rich with application opportunities to China's economic development and environmental management. Until now more than 150 papers related to emergy theories were published in Chinese scientific journals, more than 20 dissertations presented in all Chinese Universities, and a large number of emergy-based papers were authored by Chinese scholars in international journals. Also, several reports dealing with emergy evaluation of different provinces of China were presented to local governments for decision-making. Emergy theories were applied to valuation of ecosystems and eco-industrial parks, as well as to studies of benefits/cost analysis and feasibility of ecological engineering. Meanwhile, a series of monographs and translated books related to emergy theories were published in China, some of which are used as text books in Chinese universities and institutes. Compared with the great potential of emergy application, there are many new fields that should be addressed in China, including: assessing the environmental impact of processes based on matching of high-quality and low-quality resources, establishing new frameworks and systems for environmental accounting, evaluating natural capital and services and applying research results to the process of decision-making, and finally studying the patterns and the available development options of China regional eco-economic systems.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V2W-4RFKKPB-1/2/6e5815bcbcbb2de03e6d7c0cbce681b3","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2007.11.012","call-number":"0003","author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Xiaobin"},{"family":"Ulgiati","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Maochao"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Wangsheng"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",8,15]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/7EZ75MRW","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/7EZ75MRW","type":"article-journal","title":"CMF: A Hydrological Programming Language Extension For Integrated Catchment Models","container-title":"Environmental Modelling & Software","page":"828-830","volume":"26","issue":"6","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"Hydrological models are created for a wide range of scales and intents.

Here, we show that deletion of TRIM28 in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) results in high-level expression of two groups of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs): IAP1 and MMERVK10C. We find that NPCs use TRIM28-mediated histone modifications to dynamically regulate transcription and silencing of ERVs, which is in contrast to other somatic cell types using DNA methylation. We also show that derepression of ERVs influences transcriptional dynamics in NPCs through the activation of nearby genes and the expression of long noncoding RNAs. These findings demonstrate a unique dynamic transcriptional regulation of ERVs in NPCs. Our results warrant future studies on the role of ERVs in the healthy and diseased brain.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124714010158","DOI":"10.1016/j.celrep.2014.12.004","ISSN":"2211-1247","journalAbbreviation":"Cell Reports","author":[{"family":"Fasching","given":"Liana"},{"family":"Kapopoulou","given":"Adamandia"},{"family":"Sachdeva","given":"Rohit"},{"family":"Petri","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Jönsson","given":"Marie E."},{"family":"Männe","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Turelli","given":"Priscilla"},{"family":"Jern","given":"Patric"},{"family":"Cammas","given":"Florence"},{"family":"Trono","given":"Didier"},{"family":"Jakobsson","given":"Johan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,6]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,23]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/7GPUA8XE","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/7GPUA8XE","type":"book","title":"Electronics Fundamentals: Circuits, Devices, and Applications","publisher":"Prentice Hall","edition":"6","ISBN":"0-13-111138-8","call-number":"0041","shortTitle":"Electronics Fundamentals","author":[{"family":"Floyd","given":"Thomas L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",7,27]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/7H9SSMU8","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/7H9SSMU8","type":"article-journal","title":"Community perspectives of natural resource extraction: coal-seam gas mining and social identity in Eastern Australia","container-title":"Coolabah","page":"144","volume":"10","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://epubs.scu.edu.au/esm_pubs/1472/","shortTitle":"Community perspectives of natural resource extraction","author":[{"family":"Lloyd","given":"David J."},{"family":"Luke","given":"Hanabeth"},{"family":"Boyd","given":"William E."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/7IXAZ8X6","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/7IXAZ8X6","type":"book","title":"The Role of Evidence in Risk Characterization: Making Sense of Conflicting Data","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","number-of-pages":"242","source":"Google Books","abstract":"One of the few books to focus on the critical problem of the correct characterization of conflicting data for an adequate risk evaluation, this title comprehensively covers the different approaches in various research areas in the US and in Europe, while also considering the ethical implications of risk evaluation.

Methods: Cognitive and physiologic markers of stress were evaluated before, during, and after an intense training exercise conducted for 53 hours in the heat. Cognitive performance, mood, physical activity, sleep, body composition, hydration, and saliva cortisol, testosterone, and melatonin were assessed. Volunteers were 31 male U.S. Army officers from an elite unit, aged 31.6 ± .4 years. Results: Wrist activity monitors documented that soldiers slept only 3.0 ± .3 hours during the exercise and were active throughout. Volunteers lost 4.1 ± .2 kg (p < .001) of weight, predominately water (3.1 ± .3 L) (p < .001). Substantial degradation in cognitive function, assessed with computerized tests, occurred. Vigilance, reaction time, attention, memory, and reasoning were impaired (p < .001). Mood, including vigor (p < .001), fatigue (p < .001), confusion (p < .001), depression (p < .001), and tension (p < .002), assessed by questionnaire, deteriorated. The highest cortisol and testosterone levels were observed before the exercise. Conclusions: This study quantifies the overwhelmingly adverse impact of multiple stressors on cognitive performance, mood, and physiologic parameters, during a continuous but brief military exercise conducted by highly motivated, well-trained officers.","URL":"http://www.scopus.com.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-13444302557&partnerID=40&md5=4a8dd5456e5a032879bdd34e7e34e688","call-number":"0045","author":[{"family":"Lieberman","given":"H.R."},{"family":"Bathalon","given":"G.P."},{"family":"Falco","given":"C.M."},{"family":"Kramer","given":"F.M."},{"family":"Morgan III","given":"C.A."},{"family":"Niro","given":"P."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/7TNBVXQE","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/7TNBVXQE","type":"article-journal","title":"The Nature and Determinants of Customer Expectations of Service","container-title":"Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science","page":"1-12","volume":"21","issue":"1","source":"jam.sagepub.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au","abstract":"A conceptual model articulating the nature and determinants of customer expectations of service is proposed and discussed.

This allows an auditor to verify the economic picture by checking it against a more complete representation of the flows and storages of real wealth as measured by emergy. In this study, we constructed emergy accounts for the state of West Virginia in 1997. The income statement showed annual production, consumption, and flows of emergy and dollars into and out of the state. The balance sheet evaluated the storage of emergy in some of the state's assets. Emergy indices were used to answer questions posed by managers and gain insight into the state's economic and environmental strengths and weaknesses. West Virginia has great wealth in nonrenewable resources (9E14 sej m−2 or 17 times the U.S. average). The investment ratio of emergy purchased outside to indigenous renewable and nonrenewable emergy was 2.2:1, which indicates a high potential for future development. However, the environmental loading ratio (14:1) was already 1.5 times higher than that found at an average location in the U.S. Twice as much emergy was exported as received and standard of living indicators showed that people have largely failed to benefit from their state's wealth. We propose that, just as in business, where decisions made using financial accounts ensure solvency; decisions governing the environment should be made based on an emergy accounting of activities, assets, and liabilities for the combined system of humanity and nature.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B%3AEMAS.0000016890.70068.f7","DOI":"10.1023/B:EMAS.0000016890.70068.f7","ISSN":"0167-6369, 1573-2959","shortTitle":"Keeping the Books for Environmental Systems","journalAbbreviation":"Environ Monit Assess","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Meisch","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Demoss","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Pomponio","given":"John"},{"family":"Bradley","given":"M.

Our prevailing cultural myth includes a dangerous vision of global sustainability and poverty reduction centered on unlimited economic expansion, “free” trade and technological fixes. This paper dissects the modern myth, exposing its conceptual flaws and practical failings. It then proposes an alternative conceptual framework for development derived from ecological economics and ecological footprint analysis. The new framework recognizes that the human enterprise is a subsystem of the ecosphere whose growth is constrained by biophysical limits. If humanity is to seize control of its destiny it must arise above wishful thinking and tribal instinct. Global society needs a new cultural myth rooted in humanity's unique claim to intelligence and self-awareness in the face of danger.

We conducted an experiment to probe two alternative answers: the “Science Comprehension Thesis” (SCT), which identifies defects in the public’s knowledge and reasoning capacities as the source of such controversies; and the “Identity-protective Cognition Thesis” (ICT) which treats cultural conflict as disabling the faculties that members of the public use to make sense of decision-relevant science. In our experiment, we presented subjects with a difficult problem that turned on their ability to draw valid causal inferences from empirical data. As expected, subjects highest in Numeracy — a measure of the ability and disposition to make use of quantitative information — did substantially better than less numerate ones when the data were presented as results from a study of a new skin-rash treatment. Also as expected, subjects’ responses became politically polarized — and even less accurate — when the same data were presented as results from the study of a gun-control ban. But contrary to the prediction of SCT, such polarization did not abate among subjects highest in Numeracy; instead, it increased. This outcome supported ICT, which predicted that more Numerate subjects would use their quantitative-reasoning capacity selectively to conform their interpretation of the data to the result most consistent with their political outlooks. We discuss the theoretical and practical significance of these findings.","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2319992","number":"ID 2319992","author":[{"family":"Kahan","given":"Dan M."},{"family":"Peters","given":"Ellen"},{"family":"Dawson","given":"Erica Cantrell"},{"family":"Slovic","given":"Paul"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,25]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/84ZK6J7D","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/84ZK6J7D","type":"article-journal","title":"Tension and Potential from Ohm to Kirchhoff","container-title":"Centaurus","page":"141-163","volume":"31","issue":"2","URL":"http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0498.1988.tb00684.x","DOI":"doi:10.1111/j.1600-0498.1988.tb00684.x","call-number":"0008","author":[{"family":"Archibald","given":"Thomas"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["183",7]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,29]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/85AXRKHX","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/85AXRKHX","type":"chapter","title":"Towards a Theory of Brain Structure and Function","container-title":"A New Foundation for Representation in Cognitive and Brain Science","collection-title":"Springer Series in Cognitive and Neural Systems","collection-number":"7","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","page":"109-140","source":"link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au","abstract":"The eminent mathematician Henri Poincaré wrote “The aim of science is not things in themselves, as the dogmatists in their simplicity imagine, but the relations between things; outside those relations there is no reality knowable” (Poincaré H (1952) Science and hypothesis. Dover, New York). The study of the relation between the external world and the central nervous system, and in particular the brain, has been approached from numerous disciplines and subdisciplines that are recognizable under the portmanteau word cognitive. In the past, psychologists studied brain functioning, yet did not include an examination of its internal structure. The behaviorist school, that was preponderant in the departments of psychology during a good part of the last century, accorded to the biological organism a predictable behavior in terms of input and output. In the behaviorist’s view, the organism reacted with mechanical precision to the stimuli and the internal workings of the organism were considered irrelevant because it was already prefixed by the stimulus/response pair. Paradoxically, some time before Watson and Skinner gathered their behaviorist theories that disregarded the biological issues involved in behavior, the biological understanding of the brain had gained an extraordinary impulse. Ramón y Cajal using Golgi’s stain technique provided definitive evidence that neurons are discrete cells. This chapter explores three main issues. The first concern is an attempt to point out the difficulties – from an historical perspective – in delineating the relationship between brain structure and function. More specifically, I draw attention to the restricted, yet inconclusive quarrel between the different schools of brain organisation and functioning. Modular, distributed or sparse conceptions of brain connectivity may be verifiable or not, depending on the measurement technique and the scale that is being used. The second concern is to elaborate the idea that brain mappings have both form and meaning, suggesting practical implications of this idea to understand the connection patterns that underlie cognition. The last part of the chapter is focused on the introduction of mathematical descriptions, in particular network theory, to analyze brain networks. Some of the most important network measures, together with the challenges that the network-based approach is faced are outlined. A categorical framework that aims to shed light on the complex relationship between structure and function in brain networks is proposed. We take advantage of the capacity of categories to generalize graphs, to provide new network metrics useful for the systematic comparison between different connection networks.","URL":"http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-7738-5_7","ISBN":"978-94-007-7737-8","note":"DOI: 10.1007/978-94-007-7738-5_7","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Gómez-Ramirez","given":"Jaime"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,23]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/86NWKQN2","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/86NWKQN2","type":"article-journal","title":"On boundaries and ‘investments’ in Emergy Synthesis and LCA: A case study on thermal vs. photovoltaic electricity","container-title":"Ecological Indicators","page":"227-235","volume":"15","issue":"1","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"Indicators of efficiency and environmental performance are fundamental to marking progress toward more sustainable patterns of human development. Central to indicator development is a common framework through which the wide range of environmental assessment methods may make comparative analysis. Clear and consistent definitions of system boundaries and input categories are essential to their interpretation, and form a necessary pre-requisite for meaningful comparisons of competing systems. A common framework of foreground and background categories, consistent with both LCA and Emergy Synthesis, is identified and discussed as the basis for the calculation of performance indicators. In this paper a revised operational definition of the Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) is introduced, in light of the proposed categorization scheme, for consistent application to technological processes. Two case studies, namely CdTe PV and oil-fired thermal electricity production, are investigated. The Unit Emergy Value (UEV) of electricity generated by the thermal plant was calculated as 5.69E5 seJ/J with services and 5.11E5 seJ/J without services. The UEV for electricity generated by the PV system is 1.45E5 seJ/J with services, and 7.93E4 seJ/J without services. The computed EYRs including services are 6.8 for thermal electricity and 2.2 for PV electricity.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X11003086","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.09.021","ISSN":"1470-160X","shortTitle":"On boundaries and ‘investments’ in Emergy Synthesis and LCA","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Indicators","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Mark T."},{"family":"Raugei","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Ulgiati","given":"Sergio"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,14]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/88UE42D6","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/88UE42D6","type":"book","title":"Electric Waves: Being Researches on the Propagation of Electric Action with Finite Velocity Through Space","publisher":"Dover Publications","number-of-pages":"324","source":"Google Books","shortTitle":"Electric Waves","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hertz","given":"Heinrich"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1893"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/89S3R3N7","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/89S3R3N7","type":"book","title":"Resemblance and Representation: An Essay in the Philosophy of Pictures","publisher":"Open Book Publishers","number-of-pages":"225","source":"Google Books","abstract":"It’s a platitude – which only a philosopher would dream of denying – that whereas words are connected to what they represent merely by arbitrary conventions, pictures are connected to what they represent by resemblance. The most important difference between my portrait and my name, for example, is that whereas my portrait and I are connected by my portrait’s resemblance to me, my name and I are connected merely by an arbitrary convention. The first aim of this book is to defend this platitude from the apparently compelling objections raised against it, by analysing depiction in a way which reveals how it is mediated by resemblance.It’s natural to contrast the platitude that depiction is mediated by resemblance, which emphasises the differences between depictive and descriptive representation, with an extremely close analogy between depiction and description, which emphasises the similarities between depictive and descriptive representation. Whereas the platitude emphasises that the connection between my portrait and me is natural in a way the connection between my name and me is not, the analogy emphasises the contingency of the connection between my portrait and me. Nevertheless, the second aim of this book is to defend an extremely close analogy between depiction and description.The strategy of the book is to argue that the apparently compelling objections raised against the platitude that depiction is mediated by resemblance are manifestations of more general problems, which are familiar from the philosophy of language. These problems, it argues, can be resolved by answers analogous to their counterparts in the philosophy of language, without rejecting the platitude. So the combination of the platitude that depiction is mediated by resemblance with a close analogy between depiction and description turns out to be a compelling theory of depiction, which combines the virtues of common sense with the insights of its detractors.","ISBN":"978-1-78374-072-7","shortTitle":"Resemblance and Representation","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Blumson","given":"Ben"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,21]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/8AI8Z7M3","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/8AI8Z7M3","type":"article-journal","title":"Effects of water table conditions on water level changes near pumping wells","container-title":"Water Resources Research","page":"295-312","volume":"1","issue":"2","source":"Wiley Online Library","abstract":"Unconfined flow of water to wells is related to anisotropy of the aquifer, changes in the coefficient of storage with time, degree of penetration of the pumping well, and position of the water table. Sluggish response of observation wells to changes of head in the aquifer may lead to erroneous analysis of pumping-test data. The manner and extent to which these factors affect water levels have been studied by field observation, by analytical equations, and by electric analogs. The typical S-shaped curves of log drawdown versus log time, observed around wells pumping from water table aquifers, can be explained by an infinity of combinations of possible flow patterns and observation conditions. Equations developed for artesian flow cannot be used for analysis of tests made under water table conditions unless steady-state conditions have been approached or reached. From a practical standpoint the time required to approach steady flow is much greater than the duration of most pumping tests. Thus if pumping tests are to be used for measuring the hydraulic properties of unconfined aquifers, the boundary conditions attending unconfined flow must be recognized in the analysis of test data.","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/WR001i002p00295/abstract","DOI":"10.1029/WR001i002p00295","ISSN":"1944-7973","journalAbbreviation":"Water Resour.

The framework will be used by the competent authorities implementing the WFD as a decision support system to apply the WFD guidelines on a local to regional basis. The framework considers the variety of groundwater controls and pathways of different wetland types and allows a specific assessment to be made of the vulnerability of different wetland types to groundwater related risks. Seven distinct wetland types were identified and the potential pressures were evaluated. A GIS framework was developed in order to analyse the spatial coincidence of potential risks to each wetland type. The framework was tested for a trial dataset of 10 groundwater controlled wetland ecosystems in England and Wales in order to evaluate their current risk of damage.","URL":"http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/article/10.1007/s11269-007-9192-x","DOI":"10.1007/s11269-007-9192-x","ISSN":"0920-4741, 1573-1650","shortTitle":"Groundwater-Dependent Wetlands in the UK and Ireland","journalAbbreviation":"Water Resour Manage","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Krause","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Heathwaite","given":"A.

By forcing a break in the long-standing traditions of electronic drawing, transistors generated a crisis in the ontology of circuit diagrams, forcing a choice between representations that emphasized form and those that stressed function. This paper explores what was at stake in that mid-century debate over visual culture. It tracks one function-based symbol through concerns about auto-comprehension, visual communication, and electronic reliability to see how transistor symbols formed crucial sites for articulating the meanings of material devices and their relationship to the wider populations of electronic entities, especially vacuum tubes. In doing so, the article shifts the emphasis in the history of electronics from material to visual culture, recasting our understanding of postwar electronics as a history of drawings as well as devices.","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/hsns.2008.38.3.405","DOI":"10.1525/hsns.2008.38.3.405","ISSN":"1939-1811","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Jones-Imhotep","given":"Edward"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",8]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/8WSTCSSA","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/8WSTCSSA","type":"article","title":"Baseline Assessment Guideline","URL":"https://www.ehp.qld.gov.au/management/non-mining/documents/baseline-assessment-guideline.pdf","language":"en-AU","author":[{"family":"EHP","given":"Department of Environment Heritate and Planning"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,13]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/8XW2XCCU","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/8XW2XCCU","type":"article-journal","title":"Perturbation of membrane dynamics in nerve cells as an early event during bilirubin-induced apoptosis","container-title":"J. Lipid Res.","page":"885-894","volume":"43","issue":"6","abstract":"Increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin, the end product of heme catabolism, impair crucial aspects of nerve cell function. In previous studies, we demonstrated that bilirubin toxicity may be due to cell death by apoptosis. To characterize the sequence of events leading to neurotoxicity, we exposed developing rat brain astrocytes and neurons to unconjugated bilirubin and investigated whether changes in membrane dynamic properties can mediate apoptosis. Bilirubin induced a rapid, dose-dependent increase in apoptosis, which was nevertheless preceded by impaired mitochondrial metabolism. Using spin labels and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of whole cell and isolated mitochondrial membranes exposed to bilirubin, we detected major membrane perturbation. By physically interacting with cell membranes, bilirubin induced an almost immediate increase in lipid polarity sensed at a superficial level. The enhanced membrane permeability coincided with an increase in lipid fluidity and protein mobility and was associated with significant oxidative injury to membrane lipids. In conclusion, apoptosis of nerve cells induced by bilirubin is mediated by its primary effect at physically perturbing the cell membrane. Bilirubin directly interacts with membranes influencing lipid polarity and fluidity, protein order, and redox status. These data suggest that nerve cell membranes are primary targets of bilirubin toxicity.","URL":"http://www.jlr.org/cgi/content/abstract/43/6/885","call-number":"0039","author":[{"family":"Rodrigues","given":"Cecilia M.

(1) fractals and fractal dynamics (chaos) in both living and nonliving systems; (2) a generalized ecosystems model, and (3) a micro/macro deterministic model of upward and downward causation, with downward causation supervenient. Three implications stemming from these clarifications are described: (1) the limitations of reductionistic science; (2) the brain as a fractal-projective generating system; and (3) a redefinition of the mind-body problem. It is concluded that the new supportive sources of research and the new implications establish further, in ways understandable by a broad variety of people, the capacity of np to organize what we know, to unify disparate categories of knowledge within the systems thinking perspective, and to promote the rapprochement between science and the humanities.

The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source. This hypothesis was investigated empirically in controlled and replicated tests conducted in planktonic microcosms. Microecosystems that developed under a pH-controlled light regime, in which light duration was altered based on changes in an ecosystem-controllable variable (water column pH), were compared with those that developed under fixed photoperiods. According to the principle, pH-decreasing (and power-increasing) organization should selectively persist under pH-controlled light. To assess changes in pH dynamics that occurred under the alternative selection regime, in which photoperiods were not linked with pH-affecting selection or organization, the microecosystems that developed under fixed photoperiods were subjected to pH-controlled light on the last day of each test. The daily light duration increased 506 min on average in microecosystems that developed under pH-controlled light and 412 min on average in microecosystems that developed under fixed photoperiods. Selective reinforcement of acid-secreting blue-green algae in response to CO2 and nutrient limitations could account for the greater increase in power acquisition in microecosystems that developed under pH-controlled light.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380005002553","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.04.022","ISSN":"0304-3800","shortTitle":"The maximum power principle","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Cai","given":"T.

To do that, they have to be measured along side tangibles whose measurements must also be evaluated as to, how well, they serve the objectives of the decision maker. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a theory of measurement through pairwise comparisons and relies on the judgements of experts to derive priority scales. It is these scales that measure intangibles in relative terms. The comparisons are made using a scale of absolute judgements that represents, how much more, one element dominates another with respect to a given attribute. The judgements may be inconsistent, and how to measure inconsistency and improve the judgements, when possible to obtain better consistency is a concern of the AHP. The derived priority scales are synthesised by multiplying them by the priority of their parent nodes and adding for all such nodes.

This paper takes an historical approach to suggest that comprehensive planning is unlikely to live up to the expectations of its proponents. The essay is structured as follows. The first section provides short case studies of industrial symbiosis in highly different economic and institutional settings, the essentially free-market regime of Victorian England and communist Hungary (1948-1989). The available evidence suggests that market coordination proved much more favorable to the emergence of industrial symbiosis, despite the elaboration of a comprehensive policy to that effect in Hungary. Insights derived from the so-called \"Austrian\" critique of central planning are then used to explain this paradox. The analysis presented suggests that the Hungarian planners' failure was not so much the result of the bad implementation of sound policies, but the logical outcome of a top-down approach's shortcomings. Policy implications for the public planning of industrial symbiosis in a mixed economy are then derived and the case for self-organization is found more compelling. The creation of more innovative institutions that will force firms to \"internalize their externalities\" while leaving them the necessary freedom to innovate is viewed as an urgently needed and promising path towards increased, sustainable reuse of industrial by-products.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VFX-4C2R2S9-1/1/c2950e4e3c2bb519447113b794ac7882","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2004.02.008","call-number":"0056","shortTitle":"Industrial symbiosis","author":[{"family":"Desrochers","given":"Pierre"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",7,9]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9QERFMS8","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9QERFMS8","type":"paper-conference","title":"Regulatory Nirvana for Hydraulic Fracture Stimulation","container-title":"ISRM International Conference for Effective and Sustainable Hydraulic Fracturing","publisher":"International Society for Rock Mechanics","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/ISRM-ICHF-2013-015","author":[{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Barry"},{"family":"Malavazos","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wickham","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Jarosz","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Pepicelli","given":"Dominic"},{"family":"Webb","given":"Mieka"},{"family":"Wenham","given":"Dale"},{"literal":"others"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9REQEI5H","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9REQEI5H","type":"book","title":"Systems Analysis and Simulation in Ecology","publisher":"Elsevier","number-of-pages":"609","source":"Google Books","abstract":"Systems Analysis and Simulation in Ecology","ISBN":"978-1-4832-6277-2","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Patten","given":"Bernard C."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,17]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9SW3DN4F","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9SW3DN4F","type":"book","title":"Dynamical analogies","publisher":"Van Nostrand Princeton, NJ","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://www.tubebooks.org/Books/intro_Olson_1943_Dynamical_Analogies.pdf","author":[{"family":"Olson","given":"Harry Ferdinand"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1958"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,17]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9TEGKM6X","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9TEGKM6X","type":"book","title":"The Rise of Systems Theory","publisher":"Krieger Pub Co","ISBN":"0-89874-857-7","call-number":"1289","author":[{"family":"Lilienfeld","given":"R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1985",6]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9TJMSP5N","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9TJMSP5N","type":"article-journal","title":"Electrical properties of biogenic material: bilirubin rich gallstone","container-title":"International Journal of Nano and Biomaterials","page":"339 - 350","volume":"1","issue":"3","abstract":"The electrical properties of Bilirubin Rich Gallstone (BGS) were investigated by the Complex Impedance Spectroscopy (CIS) technique.

Previous studies have suggested that bilirubin affects aspects of synaptic transmission; however the acute effects of bilirubin on synaptic transmission have not been examined in real-time. In this study, using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we observed the effect of bilirubin on inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC) in postnatal 13-15-day-old neurons dissociated from lateral superior olive nuclei (LSO), one of the brainstem auditory nucleus that are highly vulnerable to bilirubin. The results showed that 10-5�M bilirubin increased the frequency of spontaneous IPSC without causing change in their amplitudes or in the response to bath applied glycine, suggesting a presynaptic locus for the action. In the presence of tetrodotoxin, the frequency of miniature IPSC was also potentiated by 10-5�M bilirubin. The facilitation by bilirubin was concentration dependent and increased with an increase in exposure time. Bicuculline only partially reduced the action of bilirubin. The action of bilirubin was observed in extracellular Ca2+-free ([Ca2+]o free) solution but was fully occluded by pretreatment with BAPTA-AM in [Ca2+]o free solution. Thus, in LSO neurons, bilirubin facilitates inhibitory synaptic transmission, in a manner independent of voltage-activated Na+ and Ca2+ channels but dependent on presynaptic [Ca2+]i. The increase of inhibitory synaptic transmission in response to acute bilirubin is a novel effect of bilirubin on the central nervous system and may have implications for neurotoxicity and the impairment of auditory transduction seen in hyperbilirubinemia.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T0H-4JMM5J4-2/2/f289f9e642a7e66f75ac09139f346291","DOI":"10.1016/j.neures.2006.02.015","call-number":"0005","author":[{"family":"Shi","given":"Hai-Bo"},{"family":"Kakazu","given":"Yasuhiro"},{"family":"Shibata","given":"Shumei"},{"family":"Matsumoto","given":"Nozomu"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Komune","given":"Shizuo"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",6]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",8,17]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9X58CJRG","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9X58CJRG","type":"book","title":"Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Volume 1: A System of Patterns","publisher":"Wiley","number-of-pages":"476","edition":"1","source":"Amazon.com","ISBN":"0-471-95869-7","shortTitle":"Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture Volume 1","author":[{"family":"Buschmann","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Meunier","given":"Regine"},{"family":"Rohnert","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Sommerlad","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Stal","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Stal","given":"Michael"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",8,8]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9XBCGQSR","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/9XBCGQSR","type":"book","title":"Basics of Analog Computers","publisher":"J.F.

It is a commonly used in water resources analysis to define the domain in which hydrologic process calculations are applied. There has been a growing effort over the past decade to improve surface elevation measurements in the U.S., which has had a significant impact on the accuracy of hydrologic calculations. Traditional watershed processing on these elevation rasters, however, becomes more burdensome as data resolution increases. As a result, processing of these datasets can be troublesome on standard desktop computers. This challenge has resulted in numerous works that aim to provide high performance computing solutions to large data, high resolution data, or both. This work proposes an efficient watershed delineation algorithm for use in desktop computing environments that leverages existing data, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHD+), and open source software tools to construct watershed boundaries. This approach makes use of U.S. national-level hydrography data that has been precomputed using raster processing algorithms coupled with quality control routines. Our approach uses carefully arranged data and mathematical graph theory to traverse river networks and identify catchment boundaries. We demonstrate this new watershed delineation technique, compare its accuracy with traditional algorithms that derive watershed solely from digital elevation models, and then extend our approach to address subwatershed delineation. Our findings suggest that the open-source hierarchical network-based delineation procedure presented in the work is a promising approach to watershed delineation that can be used summarize publicly available datasets for hydrologic model input pre-processing. Through our analysis, we explore the benefits of reusing the NHD+ datasets for watershed delineation, and find that the our technique offers greater flexibility and extendability than traditional raster algorithms.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300414001800","DOI":"10.1016/j.cageo.2014.07.014","ISSN":"0098-3004","journalAbbreviation":"Computers & Geosciences","author":[{"family":"Castronova","given":"Anthony M."},{"family":"Goodall","given":"Jonathan L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ADKP2C3C","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ADKP2C3C","type":"article-journal","title":"Software engineering economics","container-title":"Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on","page":"4–21","issue":"1","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Boehm","given":"B.

A convenient analog design was obtained by transforming the cylindrical equation of flow to a rectilinear form. The design criteria were applied in the construction of an electric analog, which was used for studying pumping-test data collected near Grand Island, Nebr. \n\nData analysis indicated (1) vertical flow components near pumping wells in unconfined aquifers may be much more significant in the control of water-table decline than radial flow components for as much as a day of pumping; (2) the specific yield during the first few minutes of pumping appears to be a very small fraction of that observed after pumping for more than 1 day; and (3) estimates of specific yield made from model studies seem much more sensitive to variations in assumed flow conditions than are estimates of permeability. Analysis of pumping-test data where vertical flow components are important requires that the degree of anisotropy be known. A procedure for computing anisotropy directly from drawdowns observed at five points was developed. Results obtained in the analog study emphasize the futility of calculating unconfined aquifer properties from pumping tests of short duration by means of equations based on the assumptions that vertical flow components are negligible and specific yield is constant.","URL":"http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wsp1536H","number":"1536-H","author":[{"family":"Stallman","given":"Robert W."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1963"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,6]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/AFHKTEZI","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/AFHKTEZI","type":"report","title":"Advanced Energetics for Aeronautical Applications.

Each of these is introduced by relaxing initial assumptions. Furthermore, this booklet covers extensions of AHP, which are typically neglected in elementary expositions of the methods. Such extensions concern different numerical representations of preferences and the interval and fuzzy representations of preferences to account for uncertainty.

Inflation is driven by increasing energy expended in getting energy; Environmental protection is an ally rather than antagonist of energy conservation; marginal energy sources become less useful as main energy sources decline; There is little potential in solar technology as it competes poorly with solar work in natural environments, agriculture, forestry, and other ancient ways of utilization; Net reserves of energy are much smaller than gross energies, and the cresting of world urban technological growth may be much closer than predicted by most government advisors.

In this dissertation, the natural wealth of forested systems of three different sizes was evaluated with emergy: two watersheds of the Southern Appalachians, Macon County (N.C.), and North Carolina. Emergy is the total amount of energy of one form that was required directly and indirectly to make another form of energy. Values are reported as emdollars (Em$) which represent the economic activity resulting from resource use.                 Benefits provided by forested watersheds were quantified based on emergy required to develop and maintain each service or product. Total wealth contributed by the multiple-use Wine Spring Creek (WSC) watershed was 4300 Em$/ha/y, and was divided among scientific research (3450 Em$/ha/y), water yield (2060 Em$/ha/y), recreation (1880 Em$/ha), and timber (1440 Em$/ha/y).                 In the 1990's, timber accounted for 3% of world emergy use, 1% in the United States, 9% in North Carolina, 14% in Macon County, and 8% in the WSC watershed. Forest ecosystems captured 53% of environmental emergy in North Carolina, 81% in Macon County, and 100% in the WSC watershed. The importance of forest ecosystems to the U.S. economy were evaluated based on emergy flows of the U.S. forest products industry and international trade of forest products in North America. In 1993, the U.S. had an annual trade surplus in forest products worth 63 billion Em$.                 Simple models were developed to explore the temporal and spatial dynamics of emergy and transformity in forested watersheds. Transformity is the ratio of emergy to energy; it measures position in the energy hierarchy of energy forms. Temporally, transformity and emergy lagged energy levels in reaching steady-state. Spatially, emergy from mountain uplands converged to the stream network, making water and its carved basin locations of high empower density.                 A model, MULTIBEN, evaluated forest empower of multiple benefits given various combinations of economic investment in recreation and timbering. Maximum empower was found at an intermediate level of economic investment, suggesting that an optimum intensity of forest development exists.","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/docview/304499470?accountid=13552","note":"Ph.D.; University of Florida","author":[{"family":"Tilley","given":"David Rogers"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ASBNXQTM","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ASBNXQTM","type":"article-journal","title":"ChemInform Abstract: Systems Chemistry","container-title":"ChemInform","volume":"39","issue":"16","abstract":"ChemInform is a weekly Abstracting Service, delivering concise information at a glance that was extracted from about 200 leading journals.

It is therefore extensively recognized that the appropriate design of the ETL processes are key factors in the success of DW projects. OBJECTIVE: We assess existing research proposals about ETL process modeling for data warehouse in order to identify their main characteristics, notation, and activities. We also study if these modeling approaches are supported by some kind of prototype or tool. METHOD: We have undertaken a systematic mapping study of the research literature about modeling ETL processes. A mapping study provides a systematic and objective procedure for identifying the nature and extent of the available research by means of research questions. RESULTS: The study is based on a comprehensive set of papers obtained after using a multi-stage selection criteria and are published in international workshops, conferences and journals between 2000 and 2009. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic mapping study states that there is a clear classification of ETL process modeling approaches, but that they are not enough covered by researchers. Therefore, more effort is required to bridge the research gap in modeling ETL processes.","DOI":"10.1109/TLA.2011.5893784","ISSN":"1548-0992","shortTitle":"ETL Process Modeling Conceptual for Data Warehouses","author":[{"family":"Mufioz","given":"L."},{"family":"Mazon","given":"J.N."},{"family":"Trujillo","given":"J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/AZ9NMIAC","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/AZ9NMIAC","type":"article-journal","title":"Elevated Total Bilirubin as a Predictor of All-Cause Mortality in Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction","container-title":"Journal of Cardiac Failure","page":"S68","volume":"14","issue":"6, Supplement 1","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WHG-4T3F99V-7T/1/e6c368f90dcff656d5577df4b0b3f389","DOI":"10.1016/j.cardfail.2008.06.182","call-number":"0000","author":[{"family":"Labos","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Huynh","given":"Thao"},{"family":"Giannetti","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Viviane"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",8]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",7,30]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/AZUT224V","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/AZUT224V","type":"book","title":"Emergy evaluation of forest production and industries in Sweden","publisher":"SLU, Inst. för bioenergi","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Doherty","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Nilsson","given":"Per Olov"},{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2002"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/B356MW85","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/B356MW85","type":"webpage","title":"Managing groundwater","genre":"text","abstract":"information on the range of actions through which groundwater is managed in Victoria, such as licences; permissible consumptive volumes; management plans and rules; monitoring and metering.","URL":"http://www.depi.vic.gov.au/water/groundwater/managing-groundwater","language":"en-AU","author":[{"family":"Department of Environment and Primary Industries","given":"Victoria"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/B3EV54GV","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/B3EV54GV","type":"article-journal","title":"A philosophical discussion of the root definition in soft systems thinking: an enrichment of CATWOE","container-title":"Systems Research and Behavioral Science","page":"61-87","volume":"23","issue":"1","source":"Wiley Online Library","abstract":"After a brief review of some problems in CATWOE analysis in Checkland's soft systems methodology, we suggest that they may be ameliorated by employing Dooyeweerd's multi-aspectual philosophy.

The article also provides a concise set of guidelines that can be used when visualizing risk to avoid the dangers inherent in graphic representations (such as distortion or manipulation), and concludes with an outlook on future developments in this field.

EM embraces a holistic perspective, accounting for the multiple temporal and spatial scales of forest processes and public interactions, to balance the ecological, economic, and social demands placed on land resources. Emergy synthesis is a modeling tool that allows the structure and function of forest ecosystems to be quantified in common units (solar emergy-joules, sej) for easy and meaningful comparison, determining ‘system-value’ for forcing factors, components, and processes based on the amount of resources required to develop and sustain them, whether they are money, material, energy, or information. The Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR), the units of solar emergy imported into the watershed via human control per unit of indigenous, natural solar emergy, was determined to be 0.42, indicating that the load on the natural environment was not ecologically damaging and that excess ecological capacity existed for increasing non-ecological activities (e.g. timbering, recreation) to achieve an ELR of 1.0 (perfect ecological–economic balance). Three forest outcomes selected to represent the three categories of desired sustainability (ecological, economic, and social) were evaluated in terms of their solar emergy flow to measure outcome equity. Direct economic contribution was an order of magnitude less (224×1012 solar emergy-joules (sej) ha−1) than the ecological and social contributions, which were provided at annual rates of 3083 and 2102×1012 sej ha−1, respectively. Emergy synthesis was demonstrated to holistically integrate and quantify the interconnections of a coupled nature-human system allowing the goals of ecological balance and outcome equity to be measured quantitatively.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WJ7-49RCDV4-2&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=c3c802be42d298539246cc3c0bf0e7a9","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2003.08.002","call-number":"0020","author":[{"family":"Tilley","given":"David Rogers"},{"family":"Swank","given":"Wayne T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,20]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BCRU8DRA","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BCRU8DRA","type":"article-journal","title":"Metabolic response to exogenous ethanol in yeast: an in vivo NMR and mathematical modelling approach","container-title":"Biophysical chemistry","page":"135–142","volume":"120","issue":"2","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301462205002917","shortTitle":"Metabolic response to exogenous ethanol in yeast","author":[{"family":"Martini","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Ricci","given":"Maso"},{"family":"Bartolini","given":"Fiora"},{"family":"Bonechi","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Braconi","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Millucci","given":"Lia"},{"family":"Santucci","given":"Annalisa"},{"family":"Rossi","given":"Claudio"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BCWKNQE7","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BCWKNQE7","type":"article-journal","title":"Emergy as a function of exergy","container-title":"Energy","page":"1158-1162","volume":"32","issue":"7","abstract":"This paper aims to clarify some aspects of the discussion between “emergists” and “exergists”.

Starting with introductory remarks on the effects that Emilie du Chatelet made in her lifetime, her central position in the French Enlightment with Voltaire, La Mettrie and Maupertuis, as well as the international respect and the especially intensive reception in Germany will be introduced to the debate, which will also document the state of research as well as selected debates of the Enlightment period concerning Newton and Leibniz. The main thesis is built on Du Chatelet’s intellectual independent thought, her early and critical Lockeianism, which consequently shows that the Marquise’s scientific universalism was already outlined before she became acquainted with Leibnizian ideas. The analysis of Du Chatelet’s correspondence to Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis sheds new light on this relationship. Samuel König, who had accused her of having copied from Leibniz or himself, also had a trial of plagiarism against Maupertuis. While Maupertuis ignored her discussion on solid bodies and the problems of conservation in the letters, he took up her ideas in his thoughts concerning his Principle of Least Action. Du Chatelet’s approach to metaphysics even shows interesting relations to La Mettrie. The relationship between La Mettrie, Maupertuis und Du Châtelet is given considerable weight, covering thinking matter, materialism and “dangerous metaphysics”.","URL":"http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-2093-0_1","ISBN":"978-94-007-2074-9","note":"DOI: 10.1007/978-94-007-2093-0_1","shortTitle":"Emilie du Châtelet Between Leibniz and Newton","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Hagengruber","given":"Ruth"}],"editor":[{"family":"Hagengruber","given":"Ruth"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,15]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BJKN3M5T","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BJKN3M5T","type":"book","title":"Human physiology","publisher":"Saunders College Pub.","publisher-place":"Fort Worth","edition":"2nd ed.","event-place":"Fort Worth","ISBN":"978-0-03-072616-3","author":[{"family":"Rhoades","given":"Rodney"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BJZ6QK4H","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BJZ6QK4H","type":"article-journal","title":"Ecological Economic Evaluation Based on Emergy as Embodied Cosmic Exergy: A Historical Study for the Beijing Urban Ecosystem 1978–2004","container-title":"Entropy","page":"1696-1720","volume":"12","source":"CrossRef","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/search/?q=Ecological+Economic+Evaluation+Based+on+Emergy+as+Embodied+Cosmic+Exergy&s_journal=entropy&s_volume=&s_authors=&s_section=0&s_issue=&s_article_type=0&s_special_issue=0&s_page=&s_search=Search","DOI":"10.3390/e12071696","ISSN":"1099-4300","shortTitle":"Ecological Economic Evaluation Based on Emergy as Embodied Cosmic Exergy","author":[{"family":"Ming","given":"Jiang Mei"},{"family":"Zhan-Ming","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Bo","given":"Zhang"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Li Shuang"},{"family":"Hua","given":"Xia Xiao"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Zhou Shi"},{"family":"Bo","given":"Zhou Jiang"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6,29]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2011",8,28]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BMFXAT9A","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BMFXAT9A","type":"book","title":"System Engineering","publisher":"Prentice Hall PTR","ISBN":"0-13-095085-8","call-number":"1012","author":[{"family":"Stevens","given":"Dennis G."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",6,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BMMPMRVI","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BMMPMRVI","type":"book","title":"Guidebook on mapping groundwater vulnerability","publisher":"Heise","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201300287789","author":[{"family":"Vrba","given":"Jaroslav"},{"family":"Zaporozec","given":"Alexander"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1994"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,26]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BQB8I22A","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BQB8I22A","type":"book","title":"History Of Electricity","publisher":"Hawthorne Books","source":"Amazon.com","call-number":"0049","author":[{"family":"Canby","given":"Edward Tatnall"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1968"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BQFDTC6T","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BQFDTC6T","type":"book","title":"A Practical Guide to SysML: The Systems Modeling Language","publisher":"Morgan Kaufmann","number-of-pages":"578","source":"Google Books","abstract":"Systems engineers and architects must understand how all the parts of a system work together to satisfy its requirements. SysML is a general purpose graphical modeling language used to specify, analyze, and design systems that may include hardware, software, and personnel. It allows engineers to describe how a system interacts with its environment, and how its parts must interact to achieve the desired system behavior and performance. The SysML model provides a shared view of the system, enabling a design team to surface issues early and prevent problems that would otherwise delay development and degrade design quality. Since SysML is based on UML, it also facilitates integration between systems and software development. SysML is now being adopted by companies across a broad range of industry, including Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, and IT System Developers. This book provides a comprehensive and practical guide for modeling systems with SysML. It includes a full description of the language along with a quick reference guide, and shows how the language can be applied to specify, analyze, and design systems. It contains examples to help readers understand how SysML can be used in practice. The book also includes guidance on how an organization or project can transition to model based systems engineering using SysML, with considerations for processes, methods, tools, and training. *The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML *Authored by the foremost experts on the language *Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included","ISBN":"978-0-12-374379-4","shortTitle":"A Practical Guide to SysML","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Friedenthal","given":"Sanford"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Steiner","given":"Rick"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BSDBITIT","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BSDBITIT","type":"article-journal","title":"Transformity dynamics related to maximum power for improved emergy yield estimations","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"H.T. Odum originally defined transformity as the amount of energy of one type required to generate a unit of energy of another type with the caveat that the energy production system was operating under competition at optimum loading for maximum power. The caveat has been mostly ignored in emergy evaluations, often because it is difficult to identify when or whether a transformity was produced at maximum empower. We developed the model TechnoPulse to explore the temporally dynamic relationship between transformity and empower. As TechnoPulse cycled through four distinct phases of birth, growth, decline and recovery, maximum empower was accompanied by minimum transformity for the production flow. Conversely, the period of minimum empower corresponded to maximum transformity. After the “birth” of the new energy form, the period of growth saw empower increase as tranformity declined. Since transformity is the reciprocal of efficiency, maximizing empower also increased efficiency. We found that the non-pulsing situation had higher empower than pulsing, but that pulsing maximized power and minimized tranformity (maximized efficiency). We found that the national production of electricity in the US followed the pattern observed from the growth portion of the TechnPulse simulation by maximizing empower and minimizing transformity over the period 1995–2006. A contrast of two methods for estimating the emergy yield of systems (emergy summation based on common practices and transformity multiplication based on using minimum transformity at maximum empower) applied to PV electricity production revealed starkly different interpretations for PV’s role and viability as a primary source of electricity, but more importantly suggested that there is a easy rationale for employing each method. Finally, emergy evaluations can be improved by heeding Odum’s original definition of tranformity and using the minimum tranformity corresponding to maximum empower.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380014005535","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.10.035","ISSN":"0304-3800","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Tilley","given":"David"}],"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,23]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BT2B4ANU","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BT2B4ANU","type":"book","title":"Beginning database design","publisher":"Apress ;;Distributed to the book trade worldwide by Springer-Verlag New York","publisher-place":"Berkeley  CA  ;New York","event-place":"Berkeley  CA  ;New York","ISBN":"978-1-59059-769-9","author":[{"family":"Churcher","given":"Clare"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BUAH4X7I","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BUAH4X7I","type":"article-journal","title":"An emergy evaluation of complexity, information and technology, towards maximum power and zero emissions","container-title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","page":"1359-1372","volume":"15","issue":"13-14","abstract":"This paper mostly deals with the role of energy, matter and information flows within both environmental and human-dominated systems. Sustainable growth and development of both kinds of systems require optimum use of available resources for maximum power output, as suggested by Lotka's Maximum Power Principle [Lotka AJ.

Natural selection as a physical principle. In: Proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the United States of America, vol. 8. 1922, p. 151–5.], recently restated by Odum [Odum HT. Maximum power and efficiency: a rebuttal. Ecol Model 1983;20:71–82; Odum HT. Environmental accounting. Emergy and environmental decision making. N.Y.: John Wiley & Sons; 1996.] as Maximum Em-Power Principle within the framework of his Emergy Synthesis approach. In times of declining resources, this principle translates into increased efficiency and optimum use of any kind of waste and co-products. Ecosystems and any self-organizing systems always apply this strategy and their selection–evolution mechanisms are based on their ability of growing on any untapped resource available. In order to do so, they increase the number of components and patterns for resource degradation in order to optimize the resource throughput and power output. Such a strategy also applies to human-dominated, economic systems, where the ability of dealing with co-products and wastes by means of appropriate designs as well as reuse and recycling processes may lead to “zero-emission” patterns (increased complexity, optimal resource throughput, minimization of emissions, resource exchange among system's components) and be the key for successful and sustainable development. In this paper Life Cycle Assessment and Emergy Synthesis approaches are suggested as joint tools for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of progresses towards industrial symbiosis and more sustainable production and consumption patterns within a zero emission framework.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VFX-4KYXHPJ-2&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=61f1ad2635d83734fa540f2bae414772","DOI":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2006.07.008","call-number":"0006","author":[{"family":"Ulgiati","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Bargigli","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Raugei","given":"Marco"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",4,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BZXXKU26","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/BZXXKU26","type":"book","title":"An Entangled Bank: The Origins of Ecosystem Ecology","publisher":"Rutgers University Press","ISBN":"0-8135-1824-5","call-number":"0159","shortTitle":"An Entangled Bank","author":[{"family":"Hagen","given":"Joel B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/C27V663U","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/C27V663U","type":"book","title":"Computer Simulation Techniques in Hydrology","publisher":"Elsevier Science Ltd","source":"Amazon.com","ISBN":"0-444-00157-3","author":[{"family":"Fleming","given":"George"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1975",11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/C324NWP2","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/C324NWP2","type":"book","title":"Software Engineering And Quality Assurance","publisher":"Technical Publications","number-of-pages":"302","source":"Google Books","ISBN":"978-81-8431-779-4","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Puntambekar","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",1,1]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/C39RSJAH","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/C39RSJAH","type":"article-journal","title":"Sustainable water management by coupling human and engineered systems","source":"espace.library.uq.edu.au","URL":"https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:300488","language":"eng","author":[{"family":"Kunz","given":"Nadja"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,17]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/C4US58IW","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/C4US58IW","type":"webpage","title":"Underground water","abstract":"Extracting water from coal seams is essential for coal seam gas (CSG) production.

These products often have long development lifecycles and have stringent requirements for verification, traceability, and document deliverables. In order to effectively manage this complexity, these industries are required to assemble a wide array of tools that provide only piecemeal capabilities. Often, the resulting toolset provides disconnected access to partially redundant data and may carry with it multi-million dollar software licensing, customization, and maintenance costs.\n\nOSEE is being developed to provide an integrated solution to these challenges. At the heart of OSEE is an Application Framework which provides a powerful persistence layer allowing applications to utilize a common data model that is accessible to all OSEE applications.

While Hedgling appears to have been lost in bilaterians, the likely capture of a hedge-domain by the more ancient, intein derived hog-domain may have given rise to the Hh proteins.","URL":"http://www.cell.com/article/S0960982207017861/abstract","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2007.08.010","ISSN":"0960-9822","note":"PMID: 17925209","journalAbbreviation":"Current Biology","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Adamska","given":"Maja"},{"family":"Matus","given":"David Q."},{"family":"Adamski","given":"Marcin"},{"family":"Green","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Rokhsar","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Martindale","given":"Mark Q."},{"family":"Degnan","given":"Bernard M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10,9]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,8]]},"PMID":"17925209"}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CC56X6RB","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CC56X6RB","type":"article","title":"Risk Assessment and Management: Leading Practice Sustainable Development Program for the Mining Industry","publisher":"Australian Government Department of resource energy and tourism","URL":"http://www.industry.gov.au/resource/Documents/LPSDP/LPSDP-RiskHandbook.pdf","author":[{"family":"Australian Government","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CCBPQMS6","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CCBPQMS6","type":"book","title":"Public Health and Human Ecology","publisher":"McGraw-Hill Professional","edition":"2","ISBN":"0-8385-8080-7","call-number":"0147","author":[{"family":"Last","given":"John M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",3,28]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CCDZ72S5","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CCDZ72S5","type":"book","title":"Environment, Power and Society","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons Inc","edition":"illustrated edition","source":"Amazon.com","ISBN":"0-471-65270-9","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1971",2,17]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CCQ63T6X","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CCQ63T6X","type":"article-journal","title":"Coal seam gas–toward a risk management framework for a novel intervention","container-title":"Environmental and Planning Law Journal","page":"152","volume":"29","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Randall","given":"Alan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CE2ZJZ5B","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CE2ZJZ5B","type":"article-journal","title":"Towards a global governance of risks: international health organisations and the surveillance of emerging infectious diseases","container-title":"Journal of Risk Research","page":"469-483","volume":"17","issue":"4","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","abstract":"The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have introduced normative and cognitive changes in response to the challenge of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). These changes take the form of a paradigm shift from ‘an international management of threats’ towards ‘a global governance of risks’. The distinction between these two paradigms is developed in this paper based on literature on public health policy and on risk sociology. Here, we suggest that risks differ from threats (or classical risks) by being uncertain, global and anticipated catastrophes. They require an alternative paradigm of risk governance based on precaution, transparency and participation. To demonstrate empirically this shift, the paper analysed the WHO and OIE’s response to recent EIDs, and in particular bird flu (H5N1). With H5N1, these organisations have shown an unprecedented ambition to handle a ‘pre-pandemic’ virus; they have called for increased transparency from Member States on their epidemiologic status, and for the inclusion of a wider range of stakeholders into the task of epidemiologic surveillance. This paper shows that the WHO and the OIE framed EIDs as modern risks and handled them using the ‘global risks governance’ paradigm. In doing so, they seized the opportunity, in a competitive way, to legitimise a wider scope of intervention for themselves by revising their regulatory tools (the International Health Regulation and the Terrestrial Animal Health Code) and by extending the obligations of the Member States via their system of notifiable events. This shift raises the issue of the instrumentalisation of the paradigm of global risk governance. It questions States’ sovereignty, and stakeholder’s participation and it highlights the political potential of modern risks, the link with the production of knowledge and the activity of surveillance in a world at risk.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13669877.2012.761277","DOI":"10.1080/13669877.2012.761277","ISSN":"1366-9877","shortTitle":"Towards a global governance of risks","author":[{"family":"Figuié","given":"Muriel"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,21]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CEW7E3T2","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CEW7E3T2","type":"article-journal","title":"The Oregon resource interaction model: an application of systems energetics principles to decision-making in Oregon state government--1974","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","page":"169-170","volume":"178","issue":"1-2","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VBS-4BJX1HY-G/1/09e5ebf07251c1f29bbc3b1686356c1e","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.029","call-number":"0000","shortTitle":"The Oregon resource interaction model","author":[{"family":"Peterson","given":"Larry L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",10,15]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,29]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CHTAAZMZ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CHTAAZMZ","type":"thesis","title":"The biogeochemistry of strontium: with discussion of the ecological integration of elements","call-number":"0010","shortTitle":"The biogeochemistry of strontium","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"H.T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1950"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CJC8XXJE","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/CJC8XXJE","type":"book","title":"Eclipse Web Tools Platform: Developing Java™ Web Applications","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","number-of-pages":"1007","source":"Google Books","abstract":"This is the eBook version of the printed book.

The role of sustainability indicators as an evaluation method for sustainability within the emerging context of governance merits further analysis. Focusing on policy processes surrounding the production of sustainability indicators, this paper addresses two questions: what is the potential utility of indicators for policy; and in what ways can indicators influence governance? The former is addressed by exploring three disciplines with long histories of indicator application: public administration studies, urban studies and environmental sciences. The latter is addressed by distilling key perspectives from public policy literature on knowledge utilisation and policy learning, which become the foundation for clarifying the notion of policy-resonant indicators. This clarification is achieved by canvassing the spectrum of the influences on indicators and the mechanisms of their resonance in policy processes. The final section of the paper brings these arguments together by exploring two major insights in terms of challenges for ecological economics: strengthening indicator theory and practice by addressing four key ingredients; and mobilisation of indicators through their active use within the context of governance.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180090500529X","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.019","ISSN":"0921-8009","shortTitle":"Sustainability indicators, policy and governance","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Economics","author":[{"family":"Hezri","given":"Adnan A."},{"family":"Dovers","given":"Stephen R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",11,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DCTVH8RA","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DCTVH8RA","type":"book","title":"Risk communication, risk statistics, and risk comparisons: A manual for plant managers","publisher":"Chemical Manufacturers Association Washington, DC","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://www.psandman.com/articles/cma-1.htm","shortTitle":"Risk communication, risk statistics, and risk comparisons","author":[{"family":"Covello","given":"Vincent T."},{"family":"Sandman","given":"Peter M."},{"family":"Slovic","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Association","given":"Chemical Manufacturers"},{"literal":"others"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,9]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DCXNJES2","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DCXNJES2","type":"article-journal","title":"Potential Public Health Hazards, Exposures and Health Effects from Unconventional Natural Gas Development","container-title":"Environmental Science & Technology","page":"8307-8320","volume":"48","issue":"15","source":"ACS Publications","abstract":"The rapid increase in unconventional natural gas (UNG) development in the United States during the past decade has brought wells and related infrastructure closer to population centers. This review evaluates risks to public health from chemical and nonchemical stressors associated with UNG, describes likely exposure pathways and potential health effects, and identifies major uncertainties to address with future research. The most important occupational stressors include mortality, exposure to hazardous materials and increased risk of industrial accidents. For communities near development and production sites the major stressors are air pollutants, ground and surface water contamination, truck traffic and noise pollution, accidents and malfunctions, and psychosocial stress associated with community change. Despite broad public concern, no comprehensive population-based studies of the public health effects of UNG operations exist. Major uncertainties are the unknown frequency and duration of human exposure, future extent of development, potential emission control and mitigation strategies, and a paucity of baseline data to enable substantive before and after comparisons for affected populations and environmental media. Overall, the current literature suggests that research needs to address these uncertainties before we can reasonably quantify the likelihood of occurrence or magnitude of adverse health effects associated with UNG production in workers and communities.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es404621d","DOI":"10.1021/es404621d","ISSN":"0013-936X","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

A methodologically unique Australian continental model is presented with bottom-up parcel scale granularity in land use change, food, carbon, water, and biodiversity ecosystem service supply determination, and partial equilibrium food price impacts of land competition. We show that food price feedbacks produce modest aggregate national land use and ecosystem service supply changes. However, high resolution results show amplified land use change and ecosystem service impact in some places and muted impacts in other areas relative to national averages. We conclude that fine granularity modelling of geographic diversity produces local land use change and ecosystem service impact insights not discernible with other approaches.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815215001036","DOI":"10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.03.015","ISSN":"1364-8152","journalAbbreviation":"Environmental Modelling & Software","author":[{"family":"Connor","given":"Jeffery D."},{"family":"Bryan","given":"Brett A."},{"family":"Nolan","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Stock","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Dunstall","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Ernst","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Newth","given":"David"},{"family":"Grundy","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Hatfield-Dodds","given":"Steve"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,25]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DICRGMEU","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DICRGMEU","type":"article-journal","title":"Modelling of the steel-concrete interface to obtain information on reinforcement bar corrosion","container-title":"Journal of Applied Electrochemistry","page":"429-436","volume":"35","source":"CrossRef","URL":"http://www.deepdyve.com/lp/springer-journals/modelling-of-the-steel-concrete-interface-to-obtain-information-on-ah4GVIvQcD","DOI":"10.1007/s10800-004-8348-0","ISSN":"0021-891X, 1572-8838","shortTitle":"Modelling of the steel?","author":[{"family":"Feliu","given":"V."},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"J.A."},{"family":"Feliu","given":"S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",5]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2011",8,28]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DJNKDJTS","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DJNKDJTS","type":"article-journal","title":"Metabolic response to exogenous ethanol in yeast: An in vivo statistical total correlation NMR spectroscopy approach","container-title":"Journal of Biosciences","page":"749-55","volume":"37","issue":"4","source":"ProQuest","abstract":"In vivo NMR spectroscopy, together with selectively 13C-labelled substrates and 'statistical total correlation spectroscopy' analysis (STOCSY), are valuable tools to collect and interpret the metabolic responses of a living organism to external stimuli.

Arguments supporting the latter view include: past forecasts of oil shortage have proved incorrect, so current predictions should also be discounted; many modellers depend on Hubbert's analysis but this contained fundamental flaws; new oil supply will result from reserves growth and from the wider deployment of advanced extraction technology; and that the world contains large resources of unconventional oil that can come on-stream if the production of conventional oil declines. These arguments are examined in turn and shown to be incorrect, or to need setting into a broader context. The paper concludes therefore that such arguments cannot be used to rule out calculations that the resource-limited peak in the world's production of conventional oil will occur in the near term. Moreover, peaking of conventional oil is likely to impact the world's total availability of oil where the latter includes non-conventional oil and oil substitutes.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V2S-4SP49TB-1/1/f993fa8165cbe4e04567a1e7dd613fb3","DOI":"10.1016/j.energy.2008.04.001","call-number":"0011","shortTitle":"Global oil peaking","author":[{"family":"Meng","given":"Q.Y."},{"family":"Bentley","given":"R.W."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",8]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",7,22]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DNGHX5QA","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DNGHX5QA","type":"report","title":"Water Quality Metadata Guidelines","collection-title":"National Information Management Protocols for Water Quality Monitoring","publisher":"Environment and Resource Sciences Department of Environment and Resource Management","publisher-place":"State of Queensland","event-place":"State of Queensland","URL":"http://www.bom.gov.au/water/standards/projects/documents/wq_metadata_guidelines.pdf","number":"Report A","author":[{"family":"Ryan","given":"Jennifer"},{"literal":"Rodrigues, Katrina"},{"literal":"De Hayr, Rob"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DPQIBK56","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DPQIBK56","type":"book","title":"Marx and Nature: A Red and Green Perspective","publisher":"Palgrave Macmillan","edition":"1st ed","ISBN":"0-312-21940-7","call-number":"0119","shortTitle":"Marx and Nature","author":[{"family":"Burkett","given":"Paul"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",2,15]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DS8WZ6G2","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DS8WZ6G2","type":"article","title":"Water Quality Metadata","publisher":"Bureau of Meteorology","URL":"http://www.bom.gov.au/water/standards/projects/documents/Initial-Draft-National-Industry-Guideline-for-Water-Quality-Medadata-April-2014.docx","shortTitle":"Water Quality Metadata","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Bureau of Meterology","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,22]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DSHSC449","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DSHSC449","type":"article-journal","title":"Risk Communication: Facing Public Outrage","container-title":"EPA Journal","page":"21","volume":"13","URL":"http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/epajrnl13&id=314&div=&collection=","shortTitle":"Risk Communication","journalAbbreviation":"EPA J.","author":[{"family":"Sandman","given":"Peter M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1987"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DSJDWFK9","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DSJDWFK9","type":"article-journal","title":"The life of James Clerk Maxwell: With Selections from his Correspondence and Occasional Writings.

It is important to study and develop quantitative methods for regional ecosystem risk analysis. In this study some new indicators and methods for measuring oasis ecosystem risk were established using reliability theory. These indicators are linked to water resource which is the key restricting factor in arid area oasis ecosystems. They have clear meanings and can also be compared in different arid area oases. A case study in the Liangzhou oasis of the Shiyang River Basin in China shows how to calculate these ecosystem risk indicators. The results of the case study are as follows: the reliability indicator risk indicator stability indicator and integrated loss indicator of the Liangzhou oasis are 0.686 0.314 0.743 and 0.301 respectively. This means that the reliability degree of the oasis's ecosystem safety is 68.6%; the degree of risk that it is unsafe is 31.4%; the stability degree is 74.3%; and 30.1% of the oasis's area is supported by over-exploiting underground water and damaging the lower reaches of the ecosystem. This result can be used as a guide in controlling and managing ecosystem risk in the research area.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1001074207600850","DOI":"10.1016/S1001-0742(07)60085-0","ISSN":"1001-0742","shortTitle":"Evaluation of oasis ecosystem risk by reliability theory in an arid area","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Environmental Sciences","author":[{"family":"LI","given":"Wei-de"},{"family":"LI","given":"Zi-zhen"},{"family":"WANG","given":"Ji-quan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,13]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DUHWGU7T","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/DUHWGU7T","type":"article-journal","title":"Somatic retrotransposition alters the genetic landscape of the human brain","container-title":"Nature","page":"534-537","volume":"479","issue":"7374","source":"www.nature.com","abstract":"Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that use a germline /`copy-and-paste/' mechanism to spread throughout metazoan genomes. At least 50 per cent of the human genome is derived from retrotransposons, with three active families (L1, Alu and SVA) associated with insertional mutagenesis and disease. Epigenetic and post-transcriptional suppression block retrotransposition in somatic cells, excluding early embryo development and some malignancies. Recent reports of L1 expression and copy number variation in the human brain suggest that L1 mobilization may also occur during later development. However, the corresponding integration sites have not been mapped. Here we apply a high-throughput method to identify numerous L1, Alu and SVA germline mutations, as well as 7,743 putative somatic L1 insertions, in the hippocampus and caudate nucleus of three individuals. Surprisingly, we also found 13,692 somatic Alu insertions and 1,350 SVA insertions. Our results demonstrate that retrotransposons mobilize to protein-coding genes differentially expressed and active in the brain. Thus, somatic genome mosaicism driven by retrotransposition may reshape the genetic circuitry that underpins normal and abnormal neurobiological processes.","URL":"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7374/full/nature10531.html","DOI":"10.1038/nature10531","ISSN":"0028-0836","journalAbbreviation":"Nature","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Baillie","given":"J.

With only limited independent research on the potential environmental impacts of produced water, is it necessary for industry and government policy makers and regulators to draw upon the experiences of related endeavours such as mining and groundwater extraction accepting that the conclusions may not always be directly transferrable. CSG is widely touted in Australia as having the potential to provide significant economic and energy security benefits, yet the environmental and health policies and the planning and regulatory setting are yet to mature and are continuing to evolve amidst ongoing social and environmental concerns and political indecision. In this review, produced water has been defined as water that is brought to the land surface during the process of recovering methane gas from coal seams and includes water sourced from CSG wells as well as flowback water associated with drilling, hydraulic fracturing and gas extraction. A brief overview of produced water generation, its characteristics and environmental issues is provided. A review of past lessons and identification of potential risks, including disposal options, is included to assist in planning and management of this industry.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-015-4254-8","DOI":"10.1007/s11356-015-4254-8","ISSN":"0944-1344, 1614-7499","shortTitle":"Managing produced water from coal seam gas projects","journalAbbreviation":"Environ Sci Pollut Res","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Davies","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Gore","given":"Damian B."},{"family":"Khan","given":"Stuart J."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,19]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,24]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/E4TR9QKA","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/E4TR9QKA","type":"article-journal","title":"A Measurable and Testable Brain-Based Emergent Interactionism","container-title":"Journal of Mind and Behavior","page":"201–219","volume":"201","issue":"2","source":"PhilPapers","author":[{"family":"Vandervert","given":"Larry R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1991"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/E63UUNQD","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/E63UUNQD","type":"article-journal","title":"Social License to Operate for Mining Companies in the Russian Arctic: Two Cases in the Murmansk Region","container-title":"Arctic yearbook 2014","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://www.arcticyearbook.com/index.php/briefing-notes2014/120-social-license-to-operate-for-mining-companies-in-the-russian-arctic-two-cases-in-the-murmansk-region","shortTitle":"Social License to Operate for Mining Companies in the Russian Arctic","author":[{"family":"Riabova","given":"Larissa"},{"family":"Didyk","given":"Vladimir"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/E6UMH6IB","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/E6UMH6IB","type":"article-journal","title":"Towards the sequential assimilation of SAR-derived water stages into hydraulic models using the Particle Filter: proof of concept","container-title":"Hydrol.

At present, the hydrogen production from photocatalytic water decomposition has a low efficiency. In order to determine a valuable hydrogen production process from photocatalytic water decomposition in the aspect of energy conversion, the concept of critical conversion efficiency of light energy is proposed in this paper. Critical conversion efficiency of light energy is defined as the conversion efficiency of light energy when the hydrogen energy output is equal to an equivalent energy input of the system. The criterion introduced is that only if the conversion efficiency of light energy is greater than the critical one, an energy profit can be achieved in a system. A hypothetical system with 20,000�tons annual hydrogen production by using Na2S/Na2SO3 as the sacrificial reagent is analyzed and calculated in this paper to determine the critical conversion efficiency of light energy by means of energy balance, cumulative exergy balance, and emergy balance, respectively. The results show that the critical conversion efficiency of light energy determined by emergy balance is the most reasonable, which gives the figure around 15%.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6V3F-4SNPPXV-4/1/76cd65037d06a6e76504bb82a719844c","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.04.033","call-number":"0004","author":[{"family":"Feng","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Mao","given":"Wenyi"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Wei"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,29]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,29]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ENDH6FNI","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ENDH6FNI","type":"book","title":"Energy systems overview of the Amazon basin: Report to the Cousteau Society","publisher":"Center for Wetlands, University of Florida","call-number":"0076","shortTitle":"Energy systems overview of the Amazon basin","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard T"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1986"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/EQJ9D275","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/EQJ9D275","type":"book","title":"Simulation-Based Engineering of Complex Systems","publisher":"Wiley-Interscience","edition":"1","source":"Amazon.com","ISBN":"0-470-40129-X","author":[{"family":"Clymer","given":"John R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",3,16]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ESPM24PX","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ESPM24PX","type":"article-journal","title":"Energy hierarchy and transformity in the universe","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","page":"17–28","volume":"178","issue":"1","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438000300512X","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Mark T."},{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard T."},{"family":"Jorgensen","given":"S.

It is thought to have flown to America or Argentina. As a prelude to this disappearing act, the SS murdered most of the scientists and technicians involved with the project, a secret weapon that according to one German Nobel prize-winning physicist, was given a classification of \"decisive for the war,\" a security classification higher than any other secret weapons project in the Third Reich, including its atomic bomb. What was \"The Bell\"? What new physics might the Nazis have discovered with it? How far did the Nazis go after the war to protect the advanced energy technology that it represented?

Odum, building upon his seminal work outlining the energy basis for man and nature, the method is still developing. Some very important aspects of the method, such as the global baseline for renewable emergy and how the emergy yield ratio (EYR), a critical index for implicating the contribution of a process to society, is to be calculated are still under debate in the scientific community. This makes it all the more critical that when an emergy analysis is done all methodology is laid bare and justified. Unfortunately, Zhang et al. (2012. Energy Policy 42, pp 232–238) is deficient in doing so. In the response below I lay out the problems I observed in the paper and propose a revision to their analysis. I should note that no issues were found with the embodied energy portion of the analysis and the inconsistencies with accepted methodology were likely due to an unfamiliarity with the emergy method.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513003200","DOI":"10.1016/j.enpol.2013.04.067","ISSN":"0301-4215","journalAbbreviation":"Energy Policy","author":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Elliott"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,9]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/EXJQW353","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/EXJQW353","type":"book","title":"The dialectical biologist","publisher":"Harvard University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, Mass","number-of-pages":"ix, 303","source":"UQ Library Search, Summon 2.0","event-place":"Cambridge, Mass","ISBN":"978-0-674-20281-8","call-number":"QH331 .L529 1985","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Levins","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Lewontin","given":"Richard C."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1985"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/EZEUAZAG","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/EZEUAZAG","type":"article","title":"The National Harmonised Regulatory Framework for Natural Gas from Coal Seams","publisher":"Australian Government","URL":"http://www.scer.gov.au/files/2013/09/National-Harmonised-Regulatory-Framework-for-Natural-Gas-from-Coal-Seams.pdf","author":[{"family":"SCER","given":"Standing Council on Energy and Resources"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/F36EIG7A","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/F36EIG7A","type":"webpage","title":"Environmental assessments and conditions","genre":"Collection","abstract":"Queensland CSG and LNG operators must be issued with an environmental authority (EA) before they can start work.","URL":"https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industry/csg-lng-industry/water-environmental-management-csg/environmental-assessments-conditions","language":"en-AU","author":[{"family":"DNRM","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,6]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/F3HRZSIC","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/F3HRZSIC","type":"article-journal","title":"The maximum power principle predicts the outcomes of two-species competition experiments","container-title":"Oikos","page":"1329–1336","volume":"117","issue":"9","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2008.16832.x/pdf","author":[{"family":"DeLong","given":"John P."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,30]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/F4PMKDZI","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/F4PMKDZI","type":"book","title":"Physics for JavaScript games, animation, and simulations: with HTML5 canvas","collection-title":"The expert's voice in Web development","publisher":"Apress","publisher-place":"Berkeley, CA","number-of-pages":"1 online resource (xxiv, 466 pages)","source":"UQ Library Search, Summon 2.0","event-place":"Berkeley, CA","abstract":"\"Have you ever wanted to include believable physical behaviors in your games and projects to give them that extra edge? Physics for JavaScript Games, Animation, and Simulations teaches you how to incorporate real physics, such as gravity, friction, and buoyancy, into your HTML5 games, animations, and simulations. It also includes more advanced topics, such as particle systems, which are essential for creating effects such as sparks or smoke. The book also addresses the key issue of balancing accuracy and simplicity in your games and simulations, and the final chapters provide you with the information and the code to make the right choice for your project. Physics for JavaScript Games, Animation, and Simulations assumes you have a basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML5.

The concept of somatic dysfunction is revisited in light of the several fascial influences that may come into play during and after manual treatment. A change in perspective is thus proposed: from a nociceptive model that for decades has viewed somatic dysfunction as a neurologically-mediated phenomenon, to a unifying neuro-fascial model that integrates neural influences into a multifactorial and multidimensional interpretation of manual therapeutic effects as being partially, if not entirely, mediated by the fascia. By taking into consideration a wide spectrum of fascia-related factors – from cell-based mechanisms to cognitive and behavioural influences – a model emerges suggesting, amongst other results, a multidisciplinary-approach to the intervention of somatic dysfunction. Finally, it is proposed that a sixth osteopathic ‘meta-model’ – the connective tissue-fascial model – be added to the existing five models in osteopathic philosophy as the main interface between all body systems, thus providing a structural and functional framework for the body's homoeostatic potential and its inherent abilities to heal.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136085921500056X","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbmt.2015.03.002","ISSN":"1360-8592","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Bodywork and Movement Therapies","author":[{"family":"Tozzi","given":"Paolo"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",7]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/FF47TSRI","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/FF47TSRI","type":"article-journal","title":"MES (multi-energy systems): An overview of concepts and evaluation models","container-title":"Energy","page":"1-17","volume":"65","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"MES (multi-energy systems) whereby electricity, heat, cooling, fuels, transport, and so on optimally interact with each other at various levels (for instance, within a district, city or region) represent an important opportunity to increase technical, economic and environmental performance relative to “classical” energy systems whose sectors are treated “separately” or “independently”.

It evaluates work done by water energies on the landscape and explores an hypothesis that \"self organizing watersheds couple the geopotential and chemical potential energy use to maximize biological and geological production\". Work of water in the mountains was measured by the geopotential energy use and related to work on terrestrial productivity of valleys measured by the chemical potential energy evapotranspired. Using data on rainfall and river flow data and topographic geographic information, spatial and temporal energy analysis and sc EMERGY evaluations were performed for six Brazilian watersheds of the Ribeira de Iguape River basin, and for the Coweeta River basin in North Carolina. sc EMERGY is the energy of one kind used directly and indirectly to make a product or service. Maps and graphs included.                 Evaluations revealed two typical watershed shapes--bowl-shaped and plateau basins. Bowl-shaped basins optimized the use of the water energies, with a ratio of chemical potential energy used to geopotential energy used between 1.3 and 1.5. This ratio was 0.4 to 0.6 for the plateau basins. The geopotential energy use per area and the empower densities for the bowl-shaped basins were maximum at middle elevations, coinciding with cited zones of maximum native biodiversity.                 sc EMERGY of the river waters accumulated through the river network enabled the pulsed delivery of residual geopotential energy, nutrients and sediments to have a large effect on lowland productivity, measured by the high transformities of about 2E6 solar emjoules per joule. About half of the rain chemical potential energy was transferred to estuaries dowstream. From headwaters to delta, transformities of chemical potential energy ranged from 2E4 to 6E4 solar emjoules per joule.                 A computer model simulated changes in the valley productivity due to construction of one or more small dams. Dams reduced flood pulses and decreased floodplain productivity by 15 to 26%.

MRS and fMRI experiments show that the majority of cerebral activity, which is often disregarded in imaging experiments, is ongoing even when the brain appears to be doing nothing.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T0V-4CPM210-1/1/f50a65991a54750ffad57d5a3ac50229","DOI":"10.1016/j.tins.2004.06.005","call-number":"0125","shortTitle":"Energetic basis of brain activity","author":[{"family":"Shulman","given":"Robert G."},{"family":"Rothman","given":"Douglas L."},{"family":"Behar","given":"Kevin L."},{"family":"Hyder","given":"Fahmeed"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",8,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",5,13]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/FT6JI3KG","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/FT6JI3KG","type":"thesis","title":"Emergy evaluation of water","publisher":"University of Florida","publisher-place":"United States -- Florida","event-place":"United States -- Florida","abstract":"To better understand the values of water within different contexts and spatial scales, the emergy inputs to water were evaluated and compared at four scales: (1) global, (2) regional (the state of Florida), (3) local (water supply utilities), and (4) small-scale (home water purification). Emergy (spelled with an \"m\") represents all the previous work of one kind required to generate a product or provide a service.                 Since water can be found at all stages of the global hierarchy of biogeochemical processes, it has many emergy values and transformities. Transformities of water indicate the convergence of energy and materials that are required to produce the water. Global water storages were evaluated using the total emergy driving the geobiochemical processes of the biosphere and storage turnover times. Transformities for these water storages varied between 3.54 E3 sej/J (water vapor) and 1.05 E6 sej/J (glaciers). Calculated transformities for global water flows ranged from 3.96 E3 sej/J (precipitation) to 9.55 E5 sej/J (ice melt).                 Regional transformities of water resources reflected specific conditions of the landscape. The mean transformities for water in estuaries, rivers, lakes, wetlands and deep groundwater storages in Florida were calculated at 3.19 E4, 4.26 E4, 5.64 E4, 7.09 E4 and 1.66 E5 sej/J, respectively.                 Eight local water supply utilities in Florida were evaluated to determine the emergy cost of producing potable water. Potable water transformities ranged from 1.39 E5 (West Palm Beach plant) to 1.39 E6 (Stock Island reverse osmosis plant). Five home water purification processes were evaluated to compare the emergy costs of producing potable water just for drinking, yielding transformities between 5.19 E6 (filtered water) and 3.16 E7 sej/J (bottled water).                 To test theories of the appropriate use of water to maximize economic vitality, a computer model of a generalized regional production function was simulated. Using Florida as a case study, maximum total production occurred when the economic/urban sector, the agricultural sector, and the environment received approximately 25, 30, and 45%, respectively, of the fresh water remaining after evapotranspiration.                 Since the calculated transformities for potable water are equivalent in magnitude to gasoline and electricity, the use of potable water should correspond with its high value. Therefore, measures need to be taken at local and regional levels to use potable water more appropriately.","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/docview/304692621?accountid=13552","note":"Ph.D.; University of Florida","author":[{"family":"Buenfil","given":"Andres A"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/FTJ8P9VC","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/FTJ8P9VC","type":"article-journal","title":"Trophic Structure and Productivity of a Windward Coral Reef Community on Eniwetok Atoll","container-title":"Ecological Monographs","page":"291-320","volume":"25","issue":"3","call-number":"0508","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"H.

Antigravity technology, originally spearheaded by scientists in Nazi Germany, was another high priority, one that still may be in effect today. Now for the first time, a reporter with an unprecedented access to key sources in the intelligence and military communities reveals suppressed evidence that tells the story of a quest for a discovery that could prove as powerful as the A-bomb.The Hunt for Zero Point explores the scientific speculation that a \"zero point\" of gravity exists in the universe and can be replicated here on Earth. The pressure to be the first nation to harness gravity is immense, as it means having the ability to build military planes of unlimited speed and range, along with the most deadly weaponry the world has ever seen. The ideal shape for a gravity-defying vehicle happens to be a perfect disk, making antigravity tests a possible explanation for the numerous UFO sightings of the past 50 years.Chronicling the origins of antigravity research in the world's most advanced research facility, which was operated by the Third Reich during World War II, The Hunt for Zero Point traces U.S. involvement in the project, beginning with the recruitment of former Nazi scientists after the war. Drawn from interviews with those involved with the research and who visited labs in Europe and the United States, The Hunt for Zero Point journeys to the heart of the twentieth century's most puzzling unexplained phenomena.From the Hardcover edition.","ISBN":"978-0-307-41943-9","shortTitle":"The Hunt for Zero Point","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"Nick"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",12,18]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/FUWQZDQ6","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/FUWQZDQ6","type":"book","title":"Biofeedback and somatics : toward personal evolution","publisher":"Freeperson Press","publisher-place":"Novato  Calif.","edition":"1st ed.","event-place":"Novato  Calif.","ISBN":"978-0-918236-06-7","call-number":"0013","author":[{"family":"Criswell","given":"Eleanor"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/FXT43ZBZ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/FXT43ZBZ","type":"article-journal","title":"The Earth is not yet an artifact","container-title":"Technology and Society Magazine, IEEE","page":"25-28","volume":"19","issue":"4","abstract":"Responds to B.

The production system of cassava-based fuel ethanol (CFE) was evaluated by emergy analysis. The emergy indices for the system of cassava-based fuel ethanol (CFE) are as follows: transformity is 1.10 E + 5 sej/J, EYR is 1.07, ELR is 2.55, RER is 0.28, and ESI is 0.42. Compared with the emergy indices of wheat ethanol and corn ethanol, CFE is the most sustainable. CFE is a good alternative to substitute for oil in China.

Zooming the macroscope: medium-resolution remote sensing as a framework for the assessment of a small-scale fishery. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 68: 696–706.\n\nManagement of small-scale fisheries targeting sedentary stocks requires integration of information about processes operating and observable at different spatial and temporal scales. An integrated approach was developed with a scallop (Aequipecten tehuelchus) fishery in a small, semi-enclosed Patagonian basin as a demonstration case. Medium-resolution (30 m2) satellite (Landsat) data, used to identify circulation patterns, were combined with information from fishery surveys and recruitment experiments to link oceanographic processes with population dynamics. A frontal system splits San José Gulf (northern Argentine Patagonia) into two oceanographic domains (East and West) with distinct hydrographic regimes. In the West Domain, where circulation is highly advective and governed by turbulent vorticial fluxes, larval settlement on artificial collectors was insignificant over five reproductive seasons and no important scallop grounds were ever found. In the East Domain, where the main fishing grounds are, spat abundance varied between sites and years, but was always significant. Growth rates displayed strong clinal variation within the East Domain, decreasing clockwise away from the entrance to the Gulf and reflecting inferred circulation and gradual nutrient extinction. A physical mechanism capable of dispersing larvae over long distances towards the north, into the adjacent San Matias Gulf, was identified from Landsat images. The large-scale patterns of variation in growth, distribution, and recruitment of the Tehuelche scallop stock could not have been interpreted without an integrative approach to data assemblage and analysis, including satellite remote sensing.","URL":"http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/content/68/4/696.abstract","DOI":"10.1093/icesjms/fsq162","shortTitle":"Zooming the macroscope","author":[{"family":"Amoroso","given":"Ricardo O."},{"family":"Parma","given":"Ana M."},{"family":"Orensanz","given":"J.

Current extraction is assessed at 67 GL/a (gigalitres per annum), while the best available scientific data estimates the sustainable groundwater system yield is closer to 40 GL/a (CSIRO, 2008). Peak organisations accept overallocation as a critical issue but conflict over water has disrupted several past attempts at regulation. To assist local communities and the planning agency, seven planning tools were used: (1) an extended stakeholder analysis and context report, (2) a program of engagement with Traditional Custodians, (3) intergenerational workshops, (4) a survey of groundwater users covering issues in setting and meeting the agreed system yield, (5) a multi-criteria analysis relating to setting and apportioning the available yield, (6) a pilot workshop addressing adaptation to climate risk, and (7) development of a three-dimensional groundwater visualisation tool relating to the regional aquifers. Results fed directly into pre-planning processes undertaken by the State water agency. The tools allowed a much broader range of voices, values and depth of information to feed into the planning process than otherwise available. Participants found the Indigenous engagement tool and the GVT the most useful. The latter addressed identified information gaps and allowed for aquifer characteristics and the interaction with bores to be presented in a user-friendly manner. Intergenerational perspectives about using water within sustainable limits were also obtained but the Community Reference Panel did not place any weight on this perspective in discussions over the plan amendment. Evaluations of the tools demonstrate that a range of planning tools can be readily used to enhance existing planning processes, particularly by sharing information and eliciting views that may not be readily accessible to water planners.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169412000236","DOI":"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.01.004","ISSN":"0022-1694","shortTitle":"Water planning in the Condamine Alluvium, Queensland","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Hydrology","author":[{"family":"Tan","given":"Poh-Ling"},{"family":"Baldwin","given":"C."},{"family":"White","given":"I."},{"family":"Burry","given":"K."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,12]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/GSGM7SEC","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/GSGM7SEC","type":"webpage","title":"Bore search","container-title":"Department of Natural Resources and Mines","genre":"document","abstract":"The Underground Water Impact Report for the Surat Cumulative Management Area assessed the impacts of water extraction by petroleum tenure holders on underground water.","URL":"https://www.dnrm.qld.gov.au/ogia/surat-underground-water-impact-report/bore-search","language":"en-AU","author":[{"family":"Mines","given":"Queensland Department of Natural Resources","dropping-particle":"and"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,6]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/GT2WC5ST","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/GT2WC5ST","type":"article-journal","title":"Maximum (em)power: a foundational principle linking man and nature","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","page":"115-119","volume":"178","issue":"1-2","abstract":"Hypothesized as a universal principle of system self-organization, selection for maximum power provided the basis for H.T. Odum’s systems-based understanding of energy transformation dynamics, which ultimately resulted in his emergy-based methods of ecosystem and environmental policy analysis. Odum’s formulation of the principle emphasized the selective advantage potentially available to systems that acquire useful energy at the maximum rate possible within their environments, with energy deemed useful if it reinforces production through increased available energy acquisition. Based on this principle, Odum postulated a correspondence of the maintenance requirements of energy fluxes with their contributions to system power acquisition. A quantitative correlate with usefulness is thus provided by emergy, i.e., by the available energy of one kind used directly or indirectly to maintain storages and flows. A more explicit and precise understanding of the energetics of self-organization was thus suggested, and Odum accordingly reformulated the principle as selection for maximum rate of emergy acquisition (i.e., empower), which provides the standard for assessment of system adaptedness in current methods of emergy analysis. The many corollary hypotheses derived from the principle include the selective prevalence of intermediate efficiencies and process rates and of pulsing dynamics, emergy hierarchies, and territoriality under appropriate energy-influx regimes. Assessments of socioeconomic and environmental alternatives might be further improved by integrating this principle with modern theories of multilevel selection.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VBS-4CKNMVB-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=f88f6eaf2106b71a176d82a4381c1a44","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.009","call-number":"0007","shortTitle":"Maximum (em)power","author":[{"family":"Cai","given":"T.

The concepts evolved over decades, beginning in the 1950s with Odum’s work on tracing energy flows in ecosystems. During the 1970s, Odum’s attention was drawn to larger scale systems that included the economies of humans and the concept of net energy. In the 1980s, Odum quantified energy quality and defined it as a “donor-based” evaluation technique. In the 1990s, energy quality was further refined and rigorous definitions for “emergy” and “transformity” were given. The units of emergy were defined as solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ) and the units of transformity were seJ/J. In addition, we provide some insights into the types of processes and systems that have been evaluated using emergy methods.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VBS-4CBV3D4-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=3bc27088fd458a4549c7cabf334c2fcf","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2004.03.002","call-number":"0061","shortTitle":"Energy quality, emergy, and transformity","author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Mark T"},{"family":"Ulgiati","given":"Sergio"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",10,15]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,20]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/GV8G3CSP","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/GV8G3CSP","type":"book","title":"Design for a Brain:The Origin of Adaptive Behavior","publisher":"Chapman and Hall","source":"Amazon.com","ISBN":"0-412-20090-2","call-number":"0436","shortTitle":"Design for a Brain","author":[{"family":"Ashby","given":"W.

Bilirubin was added to oligodendrocyte cultures at different concentrations varied between 10 and 100 [mu]M, and cultures were incubated for different times (24, 48 and 72 h). Cell viability was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. The results showed that bilirubin decreased oligodendroglial cell viability in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Bilirubin induced apoptotic cell death as revealed by TUNEL staining and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. We found that bilirubin induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) mRNA expression in rat oligodendrocytes. Bilirubin also increased oligodendroglial nitrite production in a concentration-dependent manner and NOS inhibitor partly blocked bilirubin-induced cytotoxicity. These results suggest that bilirubin induces cytotoxicity, at least partly, via the induction of nitric oxide production in oligodendrocytes.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6SYR-4967MHM-D/2/3f52a1d689a2a442d5e55842d840e703","DOI":"10.1016/S0006-8993(03)03037-3","call-number":"0014","author":[{"family":"Genc","given":"Sermin"},{"family":"Genc","given":"Kursad"},{"family":"Kumral","given":"Abdullah"},{"family":"Baskin","given":"Huseyin"},{"family":"Ozkan","given":"Hasan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",9,26]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",8,17]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/GWDFBEB7","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/GWDFBEB7","type":"article-journal","title":"Concepts and methods of ecological engineering","container-title":"Ecological Engineering","collection-title":"The Philosophy and Energence of Ecological Engineering","page":"339-361","volume":"20","issue":"5","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"Ecological engineering was defined as the practice of joining the economy of society to the environment symbiotically by fitting technological design with ecological self design.

It is demonstrated here through textual analysis that Engels criticized not the entropy law itself but the extrapolation of this into the \"heat death theory of the universe\" hypothesis. The historical debate surrounding this hypothesis is examined, showing that Engels and Marx remained consistent with the natural science of their day. This opens the way to the recognition that Marx's political economy was unique in the 19th century in incorporating thermodynamics into the core of its analysis, thus providing the foundations for an ecological economics. The materialist-dialectical view of classical Marxism led to a dynamic, open, contingent approach to the earth system, reflecting a general evolutionary perspective.","URL":"http://oae.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/21/1/3","DOI":"10.1177/1086026607313580","call-number":"0003","shortTitle":"Classical Marxism and the Second Law of Thermodynamics","author":[{"family":"Bellamy Foster","given":"John"},{"family":"Burkett","given":"Paul"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",7,2]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/H6463KZG","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/H6463KZG","type":"article-journal","title":"Contribution to the Energetics of Evolution","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","page":"147-151","volume":"8","issue":"6","URL":"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1085052&blobtype=pdf","call-number":"0328","author":[{"family":"Lotka","given":"A.

The world of family systems psychology identifies a dysfunctional process, called psychological fusion, which stems from insufficient self-definition by an individual and results in a dependency upon others to meet an innate need to feel accepted. People suffering from psychological fusion perceive any criticism as a threat, making it impossible for them to receive the critical feedback that is necessary for growth.

This article, the second of a pair, examines the use of Sankey diagrams in operational material flow management. The previous article described the development of the diagram and its use in the past. Simple Sankey diagrams follow the requirement of conservation of energy or mass and allow a physical view of production systems. Advanced diagrams integrate stocks of materials beside the flows or show the different (ecological) quality of the materials. For the purpose of management, however, a further step is necessary: to illustrate the economic value of the energy and material flows and to use information from cost accounting. The use of flow charts showing added value or the costs of energy and material flows is particularly important for production systems. This article describes examples of each of these uses as well as assumptions that must be taken into account for Sankey diagrams to be used as an effective aid for decision-making in business and public policy.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2008.00015.x","DOI":"10.1111/j.1530-9290.2008.00015.x","call-number":"0004","author":[{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Mario"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",7,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/HWIJV9RJ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/HWIJV9RJ","type":"article-journal","title":"Developing the Lismore CSG Poll-A university/local government collaboration","container-title":"Journal of Economic & Social Policy","page":"119","volume":"15","issue":"3","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=794922375366543;res=IELBus","author":[{"family":"Luke","given":"Hanabeth"},{"family":"Exter","given":"Kristin A.","non-dropping-particle":"den"},{"family":"Boyd","given":"William E."},{"family":"Lloyd","given":"David J."},{"family":"Roche","given":"Ben"},{"literal":"others"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/HWIQCCCQ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/HWIQCCCQ","type":"chapter","title":"Lecture I: The present dilemma in philosophy","container-title":"Pragmatism: A new name for some old ways of thinking","publisher":"Longmans, Green and Co","publisher-place":"New York, NY, US","page":"3-40","source":"APA PsycNET","event-place":"New York, NY, US","abstract":"Philosophy's results concern us all most vitally, and philosophy's queerest arguments tickle agreeably our sense of subtlety and ingenuity. In this lecture, the author addresses the current situation in philosophy. The history of philosophy is to a great extent that of a certain clash of human temperaments. The present clash between empiricism and rationalism is discussed at length. No one can live an hour without both facts and principles, so the difference between empiricism and rationalism is a difference of emphasis. A philosophic amateur, who desires both religion and scientific facts, will find an empirical philosophy that is not religious enough, and a religious philosophy that is not empirical enough for his purpose. The present state of philosophy presents a dilemma for the layman, who wants a philosophy that will not only exercise the powers of intellectual abstraction, but that will make some positive connexion with this actual world of finite human lives. The author offers pragmatism as a philosophy that can satisfy both kinds of demand. It can remain religious like the rationalisms, but at the same time, like the empiricisms, it can preserve the richest intimacy with facts.","shortTitle":"Lecture I","author":[{"family":"James","given":"William"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1907"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/I28XRQNN","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/I28XRQNN","type":"entry-encyclopedia","title":"Analysis","container-title":"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy","publisher":"Stanford University","edition":"Spring 2015 Edition, Edward N.

Analysis of the data revealed that many students had serious difficulties with the acceleration, the internal and external forces, and the role of the string. The present study was undertaken to obtain more detailed information about the nature and prevalence of these difficulties and thus provide a sound basis for the design of more effective instruction.

Earth systems engineering and management (ESEM) may be defined as the capability to rationally engineer and manage human technology systems and related elements of natural systems in such a way as to provide the requisite functionality while facilitating the active management of strongly coupled natural systems. The need for ESEM arises because, as a result of the industrial revolution and concomitant changes in agriculture, population levels, culture, and human systems, the world has become a human artifact. Partially because this process has occurred over time frames that are longer than individual time horizons, and has involved institutions and technology systems rather than conscious individual decisions, recognition of this phenomenon, and appropriate responses, have yet to occur.

Population and cities, energy consumption and climate change, agriculture and environment, information and electric power, capitalism and economic policies, structures and materials, human life and standard of living are dealt with in this paper as interconnected aspects of the same problem, i.e. the necessary descent phase of human economies, due to decreasing resource base.

Results suggest soil respiration rates, light intensity, and acid–base equilibrium control atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen under materially closed conditions. Experiments with the overall Combined Biome model indicate: (1) the agriculture biome has a greater effect on atmospheric composition than the other biomes due to its large area, high net productivity, and biomass harvests; (2) the rainforest, which occupies ≈20% of Biosphere 2 area, may be responsible for 50% of total community production and respiration of oxygen; (3) the savannah and wetland biomes may be sources of carbon dioxide in the long term; (4) the ocean biome has less effect on atmospheric composition than the terrestrial biomes; and (5) the desert biome may lower carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as much as 2000 ppm during low light. Diurnal curve analyses of oxygen and carbon dioxide from early 1995 produced an average community gross production rate of 23 g O2/m2 per day, a community respiration rate of 25 g O2/m2 per day, and an average carbon dioxide absorption rate of 0.2 g CO2/m2 per h.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925857498000949","DOI":"10.1016/S0925-8574(98)00094-9","ISSN":"0925-8574","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Engineering","author":[{"family":"Engel","given":"Victor C."},{"family":"Odum","given":"H.

In order to solve these problems it is necessary to take measures of coordination between the users and providers of spatial information. The Directive 2007/2/EC of the Europe an Parliament and of the Council adopted on 14 March 2007 aims at establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) for environmental policies, or policies and activities that have an impact on the environment.\nINSPIRE is based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created and maintained by the Member States. To support the establishment of a European infrastructure, Implementing Rules addressing the following components of the infrastructure have been specified: metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets (as described in Annexes I, II, III of the Directive) and spatial data services, network services, data and service sharing, and monitoring and reporting procedures. INSPIRE does not require collection of new data. However, after the period specified in the Directive 2 Member States have to make their data available according to the Implementing Rules. Interoperability in INSPIRE means the possibility to combine spatial data and services from different sources across the European Community in a consistent way without involving specific efforts of humans or machines. It is important to note that ―interoperability‖ is understood as providing access to spatial data sets through network services, typically via Internet. Interoperability may be achieved by either changing (harmonising) and storing existing data sets or transforming them via services for publication in the INSPIRE infrastructure. It is expected that users will spend less time and efforts on understanding and integrating data when they build their applications based on data delivered in accordance with INSPIRE.\nIn order to benefit from the endeavours of international standardisation bodies and organisations established under international law their standards and technical means have been utilised and referenced, whenever possible.\nTo facilitate the implementation of INSPIRE, it is important that all stakeholders have the opportunity to participate in specification and development.\nFor this reason, the Commission has put in place a consensus building process involving data users, and providers together with representatives of industry, research and government. These stakeholders, organised through Spatial Data Interest Communities (SDIC) and Legally Mandated Organisations (LMO) 3, have provided reference materials, participated in the user requirement and technical 4 surveys, proposed experts for the Data Specification Drafting Team 5 , the Thematic Working Groups 6 and other ad-hoc cross-thematic technical groups and participated in the public stakeholder consultations on draft versions of the data specifications. These consultations covered expert reviews as well as feasibility and fitness-for-purpose testing of the data specifications 7 . This open and participatory approach was successfully used during the development of the data specifications on Annex I, II and III data themes as well as during the preparation of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services 8 for Annex I spatial data themes and of its amendment regarding the themes of Annex II and III . The development framework elaborated by the Data Specification Drafting Team aims at keeping the data specifications of the different themes coherent. It summarises the methodology to be used for the development of the data specifications , providing a coherent set of requirements and recommendations to achieve interoperability. The pillars of the framework are the following technical documents:\n\n[1] The Definition of Annex Themes and Scope describes in greater detail the spatial data themes defined in the Dire ctive, and thus provides a sound starting point for the thematic aspects of the data specification development.\n\n[2] The Generic Conceptual Model defines the elements necessary for interoperability and data harmonisation including cross - theme issues. It specifies requirements and recommendations with regard to data specification elements of common use, like the spatial and temporal schema, unique identifier management, object referencing , some common code lists, etc. Those requirements of the Generic Conceptual Model that are directly implementable are included in the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services.\n\n[3] The Methodology for the Development of Data Specifications defines a repeatable methodology. It describes how to arrive from user requirements to a data specification through a number of steps including use-case development, initial specification development and analysis of analogies and gaps for further specification refinement.\n\n[4] The Guidelines for the Encoding of Spatial Data defines how geographic information can be encoded to enable transfer processes between the systems of the data providers in the Member States. Even though it does not specify a mandatory encoding rule it sets GML (ISO 19136) as the default encoding for INSPIRE.\n\n[5] The Guidelines for the use of Observations & Measurements and Sensor Web Enablement - related standards in INSPIRE Annex II and III data specification development provides guidelines on how the ―Observations and Measurements standard (ISO 19156) is to be used within INSPIRE.\n\n[6] The Common data models are a set of documents that specify data models that are referenced by a number of different data specifications. These documents include generic data model s for networks, coverages and activity complexes.\n\n\nThe structure of the data specifications is based on the ―ISO 19131 Geographic information - Data product specifications standard. They include the technical documentation of the application schema, the spatial object types with their properti es, and other specifics of the spatial data themes using natural language as well as a formal conceptual schema language 10 A consolidated model repository, feature concept dictionary, and glossary are being maintained to support the consistent specification development and potential further reuse of specification elements. The consolidated model consists of the harmonised models of the relevant standards from the ISO 19100 series, the INSPIRE Generic Conceptual Model, and the application schemas 11 developed for each spatial data theme. The multilingual INSPIRE Feature Concept Dictionary contains the definition and description of the INSPIRE themes together with the definition of the spatial object types present in the specification. The INSPIRE Glossary defines all the terms (beyond the spatial object types) necessary for understanding the INSPIRE documentation including the terminology of other components (metadata, network services, data sharing, and monitoring). By listing a number of requirements and making the necessary recommendations, the data specifications enable full system interoperability across the Member States, within the scope of the application areas targeted by the Directive. The data specifications (in their version 3.0) are published as technical guidelines and provide the basis for the content of the Implementing Rule on Interoperability of Spatial Data Sets and Services 12 . The content of the Implementing Rule is extracted from the data specifica tions, considering short - and medium - term feasibility as well as cost - benefit considerations. The requirements included in the Implementing Rule are legally binding for the Member States according to the timeline specified in the INSPIRE Directive . In addition to providing a basis for the in teroperability of spatial data in INSPIRE, the data specification development framework and the thematic data specifications can be reused in other environments at local, regional, national and global level contributing to improvements in the coherence and interoperability of data in spatial data infrastructures.","URL":"http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/documents/Data_Specifications/INSPIRE_DataSpecification_NZ_v3.0.pdf","author":[{"family":"Harrison","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Barredo","given":"José"},{"family":"Bojilov","given":"Venco"},{"family":"Castella","given":"Raquel"},{"family":"Cerba","given":"Otakar"},{"family":"Exadaktylos","given":"George"},{"family":"Isidro","given":"Miguel"},{"family":"Pfeiffer","given":"Manuela"},{"family":"Tomas","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Giovando","given":"Cristiano"},{"family":"Camia","given":"Andrea"}],"collection-editor":[{"family":"Thomas","given":"Florian"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/II8H36M7","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/II8H36M7","type":"book","title":"Picturing Knowledge : Historical and Philosophical Problems Concerning the Use of Art in Science","collection-title":"Toronto Studies in Philosophy","publisher":"University of Toronto Press","publisher-place":"Toronto","source":"EBSCOhost","event-place":"Toronto","abstract":"The traditional concept of scientific knowledge places a premium on thinking, not visualizing.

The emergy computation does not obey conservation logic (i.e. emergy computation does not obey Kirchoff-like circuit law). In this paper the authors propose to reformulate the emergy rules into three axioms which provide (i) a rigourous mathematical framework for emergy computation and (ii) an exact recursive algorithm to compute emergy within a system of interconnected processes at steady state modeled by an oriented graph named the emergy graph.\n\nBecause emergy algebra follows a logic of memorization, the evaluation principles deal with paths in the emergy graph. The underlying algebraic structure is the set of non-negative real numbers operated on by three processes, the maximum (max), addition (+) and multiplication (·). The maximum is associated with the co-product problem. Addition is linked with the split problem or with the independence of two emergy flows. And multiplication is related to the logic of memorization. The axioms describe how to use the different operators max, + and · to combine flows without any confusion or ambiguity.

Unlike the previous calculation, in which the transformity of crude oil was back calculated from the relative efficiency of electricity production and factors relating coal to transportation fuels and transportation fuels to crude oil, we analyzed the geochemical process of petroleum formation (naftogenesis) to determine the transformities of oil and natural gas. We assumed that the process of oil and gas production is a steady state process in which all the emergy required is captured in the initial input. For such a system, we can use the mass concentration of the initial input to determine the specific emergy and transformity of the products. We used the maximum photosynthetic yield in Joules of phytoplankton organic matter per Joule of sunlight as the starting point. From this initial assumption, we traced the energy transformations in the oil and gas formation process through photosynthesis, death and decay of the phytoplankton, and diagenesis to kerogen production and from kerogen through catagenesis to petroleum formation. Our results show that both methods converge to similar values for oil (54,200 solar emJoules per Joule (sej/J)) and petroleum natural gas (43,500 sej/J) increasing our confidence in the results of past emergy analyses and providing a firm basis for the calculation of transformities for oil and gas derivatives.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VBS-4FJ5XMC-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=f14cc858cd030dba5e40552b7109ce29","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2005.01.015","call-number":"0016","author":[{"family":"Bastianoni","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Susani","given":"Ludovico"},{"family":"Tiezzi","given":"Enzo"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",8,15]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,20]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/J3CC2WG3","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/J3CC2WG3","type":"book","title":"Electric Power Distribution Handbook, Second Edition","publisher":"CRC Press","number-of-pages":"900","source":"Google Books","abstract":"Of the \"big three\" components of electrical infrastructure, distribution typically gets the least attention.

Although this basic concept is quite straightforward, its implications are potentially profound. H.T. Odum pioneered the development and use of emergy, and presented it as a way of understanding the behavior of self-organized systems, valuing ecological goods and services, and jointly analyzing ecological and economic systems. Unfortunately, like many groundbreaking ideas, emergy has encountered a lot of resistance and criticism, particularly from economists, physicists, and engineers. Some critics have focused on detailed practical aspects of the approach, while others have taken issue with specific parts of the theory and claims. This paper discusses the main features and criticisms of emergy and provides insight into the relationship between emergy and concepts from engineering thermodynamics, such as exergy and cumulative exergy consumption. This reveals the close link between emergy and ecological cumulative exergy consumption, and indicates that most of the criticisms of emergy are either common to all holistic approaches that account for ecosystems and other macrosystems within their systems boundaries, or a result of misunderstandings derived from a lack of communication between various disciplines, or are not relevant for engineering applications. By identifying the main points of criticisms of emergy, this paper attempts to clarify many of the common misconceptions about emergy, inform the community of emergy practitioners about the aspects that need to be communicated better or improved, and suggest solutions. Further research and interaction with other disciplines is essential to bring one of H.T. Odum’s finest contributions into the mainstream to guide humanity on “the prosperous way down.”","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VBS-4BRPM8P-2&_user=10&_coverDate=10%2F15%2F2004&_alid=709724093&_rdoc=1&_fmt=summary&_orig=search&_cdi=5934&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_ct=1&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=63e1df22799528b23372a425fb1bdf6a","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.016","call-number":"0057","author":[{"family":"Hau","given":"Jorge L"},{"family":"Bakshi","given":"Bhavik R"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",10,15]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,20]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/JAUT42KB","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/JAUT42KB","type":"article-journal","title":"An exercise in the natural philosophy of ecology","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","page":"167-179","volume":"158","issue":"3","source":"ScienceDirect","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380002002211","DOI":"10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00221-1","ISSN":"0304-3800","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Salthe","given":"S.

Manag. Rev. 6(2):13–39, 1965), and Black and Scholes (J. Polit. Econ. 81(3):637–654, 1973). Essentially, all models are wrong in the sense that they simplify reality. However, there are numerous models available to model particular phenomena of financial markets and calculated option prices, hedging strategies, portfolio allocations, etc. depend on the chosen model. This gives rise to the question which model to choose from the rich pool of available models and, second, how to determine the correct parameters after having selected some specific model class. Thus, one is exposed to both model and parameter risk (or uncertainty). In this survey, we first provide an inside view into the principles of stochastic modeling, illustrated with examples from mathematical finance. Afterwards, we define model risk and uncertainty according to Knight (Risk, uncertainty, and profit, Hart, Schaffner & Marx, Chicago, 1921) and present some methods how to deal with model risk and uncertainty.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-04486-6_10","ISBN":"978-3-319-04485-9","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Bannör","given":"Karl F."},{"family":"Scherer","given":"Matthias"}],"editor":[{"family":"Klüppelberg","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Straub","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Welpe","given":"Isabell M."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/JEA4PZB9","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/JEA4PZB9","type":"webpage","title":"Interactive Maps with D3.js, Three.js, and Mapbox","container-title":"delimited","abstract":"Over the past couple of weeks I have been experimenting with creating 2D \nmaps that can be explored in three dimensional space using D3.js and \nThree.js.  The goal was to produce some highly polished prototypes with \nmultiple choropleth maps that could be easily navigated on a single page.  \nAdditionally, I wanted to make sure to address some of the common tasks \nthat arise when presenting map data such as applying well-formatted titles, \nlegends and elegantly handling mouse-over events.

Unemployment, poverty and debt are associated with insufficient growth. Economic activity depends upon the transformation of natural materials, ultimately returning to the environment as waste. Current levels of economic throughput exceed the planet’s carrying capacity. As a result of poorly constructed economic institutions, society faces the unacceptable choice between ecological catastrophe and human misery. A transition to a steady-state economy is required, characterized by a rate of throughput compatible with planetary boundaries. This paper contributes to the development of a steady-state economy by addressing US monetary and fiscal policies. A steady-state monetary policy would support counter-cyclical, debt-free vertical money creation through the public sector, in ways that contribute to sustainable well-being. The implication for a steady-state fiscal policy is that any lending or spending requires a careful balance of recovery of money, not as a means of revenue, but as an economic imperative to meet monetary policy goals.  A steady-state fiscal policy would prioritize targeted public goods investments, taxation of ecological “bads” and economic rent and implementation of progressive tax structures. Institutional innovations are considered, including common asset trusts, to regulate throughput, and a public monetary trust, to strictly regulate money supply.","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/5/6/2802","DOI":"10.3390/su5062802","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Farley","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Burke","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Flomenhoft","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Kelly","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Murray","given":"D.

Neurological positivism links world, brain and mind in a conceptual model which will guide research efforts in all three domains; it proposes that the preinferential data for what is knowable are in the organization and algorithms of the neurological order. Four postulates arise from this assertion: 1. the neurological order represents the ‘prime calculus’ for all knowing; 2. homological rules of transformation fully link world, brain and mind; 3. everything knowable emerges as the result of reciprocal projective mapping between the environment and the neurological order; 4. knowledge, through reciprocal projective mapping, emerges in a Darwinian fashion. Three interrelated theoretical models which underlie neurological positivism are described: 1. the computational characteristics of collective-decision neuron circuitry; 2. Darwinian neuron group selection; and 3. reciprocal projective mapping between brain and environment. Implications of neurological positivism are discussed briefly. It is concluded that neurological positivism is a systems view of world, brain and mind relationships and, that systems thinking may represent, in a general sense, a close approximation of the prime calculus of the neurological order of all nervous systems.

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.  Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.  When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.  With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.","ISBN":"978-0-596-51774-8","shortTitle":"JavaScript","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Crockford","given":"Douglas"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KB2IS274","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KB2IS274","type":"article-journal","title":"The effect of emotion on cue utilization and the organization of behavior","container-title":"Psychological review","page":"183–201","volume":"66","issue":"3","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Easterbrook","given":"J.

This offers the opportunity to generate a combined product that incorporates the advantages of both microwave techniques and spans the observation period starting 1979. However, there are several challenges in developing such a dataset, e.g., differences in instrument specifications result in different absolute soil moisture values, the global passive and active microwave retrieval methods produce conceptually different quantities, and products vary in their relative performances depending on vegetation density. This paper presents an approach for combining four passive microwave products from the VU University Amsterdam/National Aeronautics and Space Administration and two active microwave products from the Vienna University of Technology. First, passive microwave soil moisture retrievals from the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission microwave imager (TMI) instruments were scaled to the climatology of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer — Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) derived product and then all four were combined into a single merged passive microwave product. Second, active microwave soil moisture estimates from the European Remote Sensing (ERS) Scatterometer instrument were scaled to the climatology of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) derived estimates. Both were combined into a merged active microwave product. Finally, the two merged products were rescaled to a common globally available reference soil moisture dataset provided by a land surface model (GLDAS-1-Noah) and then blended into a single passive/active product. Blending of the active and passive data sets was based on their respective sensitivity to vegetation density. While this three step approach imposes the absolute values of the land surface model dataset to the final product, it preserves the relative dynamics (e.g., seasonality and inter-annual variations) of the original satellite derived retrievals. More importantly, the long term changes evident in the original soil moisture products were also preserved. The method presented in this paper allows the long term product to be extended with data from other current and future operational satellites. The multi-decadal blended dataset is expected to enhance our basic understanding of soil moisture in the water, energy and carbon cycles.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425712001332","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2012.03.014","ISSN":"0034-4257","journalAbbreviation":"Remote Sensing of Environment","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Y.

Ecological risk assessment (ERA), which is aimed at appraising a wide range of undesirable impacts on ecosystems exposed to a possible eco-environmental hazard, has been highly recommended for environmental decision-making. The existing system-based eco-risk models at different levels of hierarchical organization are reviewed, including food web-based models, ecosystem-based models and socio-ecological models are reviewed. Based on this inspection, an integrated framework characterizing problem formulation, risk characterization and risk assessment is depicted to illumine future ecological risk assessments. The possibility of integrating the various ERA modeling systems is addressed through examining the interconnections between models shown within the context of our diagrams. Furthermore, some refinements of the current system-level techniques are proposed to meet the requirements of risk evaluation in a holistic and regulatory context. We conclude that assessing ecological risk by using system-based models at different levels of organization in a combined way is an evolutionary step for the application of risk evaluation in environmental management.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380012005170","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.10.015","ISSN":"0304-3800","shortTitle":"Ecological risk assessment on the system scale","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Shaoqing"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Fath","given":"Brian D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,9]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KE3VZZP8","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KE3VZZP8","type":"book","title":"Models of nature : ecology, conservation, and cultural revolution in Soviet Russia","publisher":"University of Pittsburgh Press","publisher-place":"Pittsburgh  Pa.","event-place":"Pittsburgh  Pa.","ISBN":"978-0-8229-5733-1","call-number":"0050","shortTitle":"Models of nature","author":[{"family":"Weiner","given":"Douglas"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KE9ZRZ2V","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KE9ZRZ2V","type":"article-journal","title":"Theory of Integrative Levels","container-title":"The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science","page":"59-66","volume":"5","issue":"17","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/685952","ISSN":"00070882","call-number":"0133","note":"ArticleType: primary_article / Full publication date: May, 1954 / Copyright © 1954 The British Society for the Philosophy of Science","author":[{"family":"Feibleman","given":"James K."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1954",5]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",7,22]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KFMINSW2","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KFMINSW2","type":"article-journal","title":"Strategic regional land use plans: presenting the future for coal seam gas projects in New South Wales","container-title":"Environment and Planning Law Journal","page":"113–127","volume":"29","source":"Google Scholar","shortTitle":"Strategic regional land use plans","author":[{"family":"Owens","given":"K."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KGHGQJ6H","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KGHGQJ6H","type":"book","title":"Out of control: the new biology of machines, social systems and the economic world","publisher":"Addison-Wesley","publisher-place":"Boston","event-place":"Boston","ISBN":"0-201-48340-8","call-number":"0685","shortTitle":"Out of control","author":[{"family":"Kelly","given":"Kevin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1994"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KHB97MTZ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KHB97MTZ","type":"article-journal","title":"Realising the Enlightenment: H.T.

Emergy used to build and maintain biological organisms (which we suggest are the carriers of genetic information analogous to books or a communications network) was evaluated on an areal basis using average global emergy input to the biosphere. The chemical exergy of genes is calculated relative to detritus as the reference environment. Using generalized data for populations of organisms from bacteria to large mammals, an emergy–exergy ratio for genes and solar transformities of biomass are calculated. The exergy used to maintain genetic information is shown to be between about 0.1 and 1000 MJ/m2. The emergy–exergy ratio for gene maintenance (a measure of the emergy required per Joule of genetic information is between about 1.0 and 20,000 sej/J. Generalized solar transformities for organisms are calculated and vary between about 2 sej/J of biomass (soil bacteria) to 75 million sej/J (mammel biomass). An interesting relationship between the emergy costs of gene maintenance and the solar transformity of biomass leads us to conclude that as the complexity of the biological carrier of information increases, the emergy costs of maintaining the carrier increases faster than the information carried. We propose that the emergy required to generate the genetic information contained in the biosphere today is enormous and we suggest that it might be on the order of 2×1010 sej/J of genetic information.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6VBS-4BSVSKN-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=00473d22c63515ede43cbeece564f024","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.036","call-number":"0011","author":[{"family":"Jorgensen","given":"S.

Helping you overcome these hurdles, this book demonstrates modern computer-aided analytical techniques used to model nonlinear, dynamic fluid power systems. Following an overview of fluid power, the authors examine various relevant fluid properties, energy calculations, and steady state and dynamic analysis along with a review of automatic control theory. Turning to modeling, the next few chapters address valves and motors and then apply dynamic modeling to examples relating to pumps, hydrostatic transmissions, and valves. The book includes a unique chapter showing how to combine flow resistance equations with the differential equations governing dynamic system performance. The final chapter translates electrical circuit theory concepts to noise attenuation in fluid power systems.","URL":"http://ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/login?url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/ISBN/9780824799564","ISBN":"978-0-8247-9956-4","call-number":"TJ843","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Akers","given":"Arthur"},{"family":"Gassman","given":"Max"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Richard John"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,14]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KTA3TA7R","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KTA3TA7R","type":"article-journal","title":"Energy flow in a pulsing system: Howard T.

Organisms are selected to maximize the power of energy conversions to a useful form. However, most species have very little capacity to vary the efficiency of their energy conversions in response to variation in the intensity of the environmental power supply. Plants can respond slowly to horizontal variation in the availability of energy by growth. The trade-off between power and efficiency which is dependent on the compromise between speed and efficiency of energy conversions does seem to apply to the relative efficiencies of successive species in a sere of secondary terrestrial plant succession. The application of the power trade-off to species in a sere predicts the common general properties of growth and reproduction in succession. The power trade-off may also help to explain reproductive patterns in animals that differ in the concentration of their food supply. The thermodynamic basis of causation provided by the power trade-off could be a valuable tool for connecting evolutionary ecology with community and ecosystem studies.","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3882141","ISSN":"0003-1569","shortTitle":"When and How Much to Reproduce","journalAbbreviation":"American Zoologist","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Christopher C."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1976",10,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,8]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KV29GU4Q","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KV29GU4Q","type":"article-journal","title":"Energy analysis of using macroalgae from eutrophic waters as a bioethanol feedstock","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","page":"25-37","volume":"288","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"Eutrophication is an environmental problem in a majority of shallow water basins all over the world. The undesired macroalgae has been proposed as a biomass resource for bioethanol production and we have analysed the environmental sustainability of two case studies: Orbetello Lagoon (OL), Italy, and Køge Bay (KB), Denmark. Today, macroalgae are collected and stored in landfills to provide a solution for the excess production. An emergy assessment revealed that the main environmental support for macroalgae growth relates to water in both case studies. In OL, rain represents 51% of the emergy use, and in KB runoff from agricultural land constitutes 86%. The environmental support needed for producing one Joule of bioethanol is somewhat more than for a number of other bioethanol feedstocks being 2.12 × 106 solar equivalent Joules (seJ) for OL and 2.56 × 106 seJ for KB. However, a high percentage of the environmental support comes from local renewable flows being 40% for OL and 88% for KB. The difference between the two case studies is partly due to the contribution of energy from waves, which plays an important role in carrying macroalgae towards the coast in Køge Bay. Energy-wise, one J of fossil energy is required directly or indirectly to produce 0.09 J of bioethanol for OL or 0.44 J of bioethanol for KB, i.e. the energy return on (energy) invested (EROI) is less than 1. An alternative scenario was developed in order to investigate improvements of system efficiency. This was analysed with the full-requirement approach as well as with a marginal-requirement approach accounting only what the bioethanol production requires of additional processes, i.e. mainly transportation and conversion of the macroalgae in a biorefinery facility which is assumed to be situated close to an existing industry producing waste heat. Both emergy and EROI analyses showed that only a relatively small amount of resources has to be added to the existing system to produce the bioethanol, e.g. the EROI increased to above 1 in both systems. With the marginal approach, macroalgae may be appreciated as a resource for bioethanol production instead of considered as an environmental problem.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380014002439","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.05.006","ISSN":"0304-3800","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Seghetta","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Østergård","given":"Hanne"},{"family":"Bastianoni","given":"Simone"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",9,24]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,4]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KVWMR5TP","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KVWMR5TP","type":"book","title":"An Introduction to Metaphysics","publisher":"Anchor Books","source":"Amazon.com","call-number":"0409","author":[{"family":"Heidegger","given":"Martin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1959",1,1]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KW58W3TU","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KW58W3TU","type":"article-journal","title":"Rich picture building in the soft systems methodology","container-title":"European Journal of Information Systems","page":"351-360","volume":"1","source":"CrossRef","URL":"http://www.palgrave-journals.com.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/ejis/journal/v1/n5/pdf/ejis19927a.pdf","DOI":"10.1057/ejis.1992.7","ISSN":"0960-085X, 1476-9344","author":[{"family":"Crinnion","given":"John C."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",5]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2011",9,4]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KW88KWCI","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KW88KWCI","type":"article-journal","title":"Emergy definition","container-title":"Ecological Engineering","page":"209-212","volume":"9","issue":"3-4","call-number":"0002","author":[{"family":"Scienceman","given":"David","suffix":"M"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KWHKRDWB","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KWHKRDWB","type":"webpage","title":"AuScope Grid","URL":"http://auscope.org.au/site/grid.php","author":[{"family":"AuScope","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,25]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KXPX6W4V","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/KXPX6W4V","type":"book","title":"Quantitative Risk Management: Concepts, Techniques and Tools: Concepts, Techniques and Tools","publisher":"Princeton University Press","number-of-pages":"721","source":"Google Books","abstract":"This book provides the most comprehensive treatment of the theoretical concepts and modelling techniques of quantitative risk management.

Accurate evaluation of transformities and other emergy per unit values is essential for the broad acceptance, application and further development of emergy methods. Since the rules for the calculation of emergy are different from those for energy, particular calculation methods and models have been developed for use in the emergy analysis of networks, but double counting errors still occur because of errors in applying these rules when estimating the emergies of feedbacks and co-products. In this paper, configurations of network energy flows were classified into seven types based on commonly occurring combinations of feedbacks, splits, and co-products. A method of structuring the network equations for each type using the rules of emergy algebra, which we called \"preconditioning\" prior to calculating transformities, was developed to avoid double counting errors in determining the emergy basis for energy flows in the network. The results obtained from previous approaches, the Track Summing Method, the Minimum Eigenvalue Model and the Linear Optimization Model, were reviewed in detail by evaluating a hypothetical system, which included several types of interactions and two inputs. A Matrix Model was introduced to simplify the calculation of transformities and it was also tested using the same hypothetical system. In addition, the Matrix Model was applied to two real case studies, which previously had been analyzed using the existing method and models. Comparison of the three case studies showed that if the preconditioning step to structure the equations was missing, double counting would lead to large errors in the transformity estimates, up to 275 percent for complex flows with feedback and co-product interactions. After preconditioning, the same results were obtained from all methods and models. The Matrix Model reduces the complexity of the Track Summing Method for the analysis of complex systems, and offers a more direct and understandable link between the network diagram and the matrix algebra, compared with the Minimum Eigenvalue Model or the Linear Optimization Model.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/science/article/B6VBS-4XMH8DV-3/2/3cd9c867aac045196159cb96a10b5059","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2009.10.015","ISSN":"0304-3800","call-number":"0000","shortTitle":"Emergy algebra","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Linjun"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Hongfang"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Daniel E."},{"family":"Ren","given":"Hai"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",4,9]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MBBBUTTC","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MBBBUTTC","type":"book","title":"Relativity : the special and the general theory","publisher":"Crown Trade Paperbacks","publisher-place":"New York","edition":"2nd ed.","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-517-88441-6","call-number":"0039","author":[{"family":"Einstein","given":"Albert"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MBTV42RN","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MBTV42RN","type":"article-journal","title":"A DirectScience: The synthesis of ScienceDirect and EmSim","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","page":"518-520","volume":"203","issue":"3-4","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"A global, dynamic portal is proposed for collaborative modelling and simulation of ecological and general systems.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/science/article/B6VBS-4MV1P41-1/2/ccced2f0c50678af7fd23d201d71db08","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.11.035","ISSN":"0304-3800","call-number":"0000","shortTitle":"A DirectScience","author":[{"family":"Maud","given":"Sholto"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",5,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",3,27]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MC6C89VE","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MC6C89VE","type":"article-journal","title":"A suggestion for computing objective function in model calibration","container-title":"Ecological Informatics","page":"107-111","volume":"24","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"A parameter-optimization process (model calibration) is usually required for numerical model applications, which involves the use of an objective function to determine the model cost (model-data errors). The sum of square errors (SSR) has been widely adopted as the objective function in various optimization procedures. However, ‘square error’ calculation was found to be more sensitive to extreme or high values. Thus, we proposed that the sum of absolute errors (SAR) may be a better option than SSR for model calibration. To test this hypothesis, we used two case studies—a hydrological model calibration and a biogeochemical model calibration—to investigate the behavior of a group of potential objective functions: SSR, SAR, sum of squared relative deviation (SSRD), and sum of absolute relative deviation (SARD). Mathematical evaluation of model performance demonstrates that ‘absolute error’ (SAR and SARD) are superior to ‘square error’ (SSR and SSRD) in calculating objective function for model calibration, and SAR behaved the best (with the least error and highest efficiency). This study suggests that SSR might be overly used in real applications, and SAR may be a reasonable choice in common optimization implementations without emphasizing either high or low values (e.g., modeling for supporting resources management).","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574954114001095","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecoinf.2014.08.002","ISSN":"1574-9541","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Informatics","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Yiping"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shuguang"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MHH9295P","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MHH9295P","type":"book","title":"Risk Governance: Coping with Uncertainty in a Complex World","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"London ; Sterling, VA","number-of-pages":"368","source":"Amazon","event-place":"London ; Sterling, VA","ISBN":"978-1-84407-292-7","shortTitle":"Risk Governance","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Renn","given":"Ortwin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,1]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MHHPFIVC","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MHHPFIVC","type":"book","title":"Animal Ecology","publisher":"McGraw-Hill","edition":"First Edition, Later Printing edition","source":"Amazon.com","URL":"https://archive.org/stream/animalecology00chap#page/194/","author":[{"family":"Chapman","given":"Royal N."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1931"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,13]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MN3U95VH","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MN3U95VH","type":"book","title":"Google web toolkit applications","publisher":"Prentice Hall","publisher-place":"Upper Saddle River  NJ","event-place":"Upper Saddle River  NJ","ISBN":"978-0-321-50196-7","author":[{"family":"Dewsbury","given":"Ryan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MNGWFNAE","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MNGWFNAE","type":"article-journal","title":"Probabilistic risk analysis and fault trees: Initial discussion of application to identification of risk at a wellhead","container-title":"Advances in Water Resources","collection-title":"Special Issue on Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Assessment","page":"133-145","volume":"36","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"Wellhead protection is of critical importance for managing groundwater resources.

It is herein suggested that probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) combined with fault trees (FT) provides a structure whereby chemical transport can be combined with uncertainties in source, chemistry, and health impact to assess the probability of negative health outcomes in the population.

With the help of DRIP, residents, communities, and other stakeholders, linked horizontally or vertically with social networks, can (1) improve their awareness of disaster risks and management issues by sharing risk information as scientific expertise, experiential knowledge, and local/folk wisdom; (2) customize risk communication through analytic deliberation of risk information by employing risk-scenarios developed by residents themselves; (3) develop collaborative activities for informed decision-making that can fully utilize local resources to reorganize coping capability against disaster risks; and (4) disseminate the generated risk scenarios with action plans to other residents who have not participated in the risk communication process.","DOI":"10.1007/s13753-011-0006-7","ISSN":"2095-0055","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Ikeda","given":"Saburo"},{"family":"Nagasaka","given":"Toshinari"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MQUVUW2K","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MQUVUW2K","type":"article-journal","title":"THE STORY OF Q","container-title":"American Scientist","page":"584-594","volume":"43","issue":"4","source":"JSTOR","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/27826701","ISSN":"0003-0996","journalAbbreviation":"American Scientist","author":[{"family":"GREEN","given":"ESTILL I."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1955"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,30]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MR2U92XB","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MR2U92XB","type":"book","title":"The body electric : electromagnetism and the foundation of life","publisher":"Morrow","publisher-place":"New York","edition":"1st ed.","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-688-00123-0","author":[{"family":"Becker","given":"Robert"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1985"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MSMGTXT5","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MSMGTXT5","type":"book","title":"Contemporary accounting : a conceptual approach","publisher":"Nelson","publisher-place":"Melbourne","edition":"3rd ed.","event-place":"Melbourne","ISBN":"978-0-17-009496-2","author":[{"family":"Bazley","given":"M"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MSRDMWM8","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MSRDMWM8","type":"article-journal","title":"A brief history of automatic control","container-title":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","page":"17–25","volume":"16","issue":"3","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://www.elai.upm.es/moodle/pluginfile.php/1792/mod_resource/content/0/articulos/HistoryOfControl.pdf","author":[{"family":"Bennett","given":"Stuart"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,9]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MSW9UN7M","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MSW9UN7M","type":"book","title":"Risk governance: the articulation of hazard, politics and ecology","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","number-of-pages":"1 online resource (xxiii, 515 pages)","edition":"2015","source":"UQ Library Search, Summon 2.0","event-place":"Dordrecht","abstract":"This book explores the common language of politics, ecology and risk, and crosses their conceptual divides. It seeks to shed light on the underlying structural factors, processes, players and interactions in the risk scenario, all of which influence decision-making that both increases and reduces disaster risk. The first section explores risk governance under conditions of increasing complexity, diversity and change. The discussion includes chapters on The problem of governance in the risk society; Making sense of decentralization; Understanding and conceptualizing risk in large-scale social-ecological systems; The disaster epidemic and Structure, process, and agency in the evaluation of risk governance. Part II, focused on governance in regions and domains of risk, includes nine chapters with discussion of Climate governance and climate change and society; Climate change and the politics of uncertainty; Risk complexity and governance in mountain environments; On the edge: Coastal governance and risk and Governance of megacity disaster risks, among other important topics. Part III discusses directions for further advancement in risk governance, with ten chapters on such topics as the transition From risk society to security society; Governing risk tolerability; Risk and adaptive planning for coastal cities; Profiling risk governance in natural hazards contexts; Confronting the risk of large disasters in nature and Transitions into and out of a crisis mode of socio-ecological systems. The book presents a comprehensive examination of the complexity of both risk and environmental policy-making and of their multiple-and not always visible-interactions in the context of social-ecological systems. Just as important, it also addresses unseen and neglected complementarities between regulatory policy-making and ordinary individual decision-making through the actions of nongovernmental actors. A range of distinguished scholars from a diverse set of disciplines have contributed to the book with their expertise in many areas, including disaster studies, emergency planning and management, ecology, sustainability, environmental planning and management, climate change, geography, spatial planning, development studies, economy, political sciences, public administration, communication, as well as physics and geology.","URL":"http://ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/login?url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9328-5","ISBN":"978-94-017-9327-8","call-number":"HD61","shortTitle":"Risk governance","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Fra Paleo","given":"Urbano"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,7]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MTMZWVKV","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MTMZWVKV","type":"book","title":"Ecological Economics: Energy, Environment and Society","publisher":"Blackwell Publishers","ISBN":"0-631-17146-0","call-number":"0839","shortTitle":"Ecological Economics","author":[{"family":"Martinez-Alier","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Schlupmann","given":"Klaus"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",4]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MTUC7QTV","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MTUC7QTV","type":"article-journal","title":"A vacation realization about thermodynamics and a possible fourth law","container-title":"Biochemical Education","page":"68","volume":"12","issue":"2","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T4N-47FWBHM-C9/1/d37067e908ba36317496bb4df2181535","DOI":"10.1016/0307-4412(84)90006-2","call-number":"0000","author":[{"family":"Whalen","given":"Thomas A"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1984",4]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",7,5]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MU4VARSV","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/MU4VARSV","type":"article-journal","title":"On Onsager's Principle of Microscopic Reversibility","container-title":"Reviews of Modern Physics","page":"343-350","volume":"17","issue":"2-3","source":"APS","abstract":"DOI:","URL":"http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/RevModPhys.17.343","DOI":"10.1103/RevModPhys.17.343","journalAbbreviation":"Rev.

This revolutionary finding was initially met with resistance by the scientific community and viewed by some as heretical. A large body of knowledge has accumulated over the last 60 years on the biology of TEs. Indeed, it is now known that TEs can generate genomic instability and reconfigure gene expression networks both in the germline and somatic cells. This review highlights recent findings on the role of TEs in health and diseases of the CNS, which were presented at the 2013 Society for Neuroscience meeting. The work of the speakers in this symposium shows that TEs are expressed and active in the brain, challenging the dogma that neuronal genomes are static and revealing that they are susceptible to somatic genomic alterations. These new findings on TE expression and function in the CNS have major implications for understanding the neuroplasticity of the brain, which could hypothetically have a role in shaping individual behavior and contribute to vulnerability to disease.","URL":"http://www.jneurosci.org.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/content/33/45/17577","DOI":"10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3369-13.2013","ISSN":"0270-6474, 1529-2401","note":"PMID: 24198348","journalAbbreviation":"J.

Godel (1906-1978) is considered to be the preeminent logic researcher of the twentieth century. His noted works on the completeness of first-order logic, the incompleteness of formal number theory, and the relative consistency of the Axiom of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis established bounds on the efficacy of formal methods in investigating foundational questions. He is also noted for his unique and distinctive writings on the philosophy behind mathematics, and his lesser-known results in cosmology raised problematic issues in the philosophy of time. Dawson, a logician and historian of science, examines the life of this driven man whose work on the foundation of mathematics has fundamentally changed our thoughts on these subjects and has stimulated much of the research conducted in this century. He further explores the relationship between Godel's personality and his scientific achievements and describes the impact Godel's results have had on our modern world view.","ISBN":"1-56881-025-3","call-number":"QA29.G58 D39 1997","shortTitle":"Logical dilemmas","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Dawson","given":"John W."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/NRP6VTGF","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/NRP6VTGF","type":"article-journal","title":"Self-Organization, Transformity, and Information","container-title":"Science","page":"1132-1139","volume":"242","issue":"4882","abstract":"Ecosystems and other self-organizing systems develop system designs and mathematics that reinforce energy use, characteristically with alternate pulsing of production and consumption, increasingly recognized as the new paradigm.

Sociological research dating back to the 1970s links rapid oil and gas development with overburdened municipal services, upended social and cultural patterns, and volatile economic growth. Research on technological risk has demonstrated communities can come to be associated with pollution and contamination, resulting in out-migration, declining amenity-led development, and decreased financial investment. Emerging shale energy case studies in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, and Texas show a similar, although nuanced, picture of these concerns. Yet, little data exists on the prevalence or magnitude of these risks in the current context of shale gas development. The existing research has largely remained case-based in nature, has not been synthesized across various disciplines, and has not been updated to account for various social and technological trends that have occurred since its publication. This paper offers a critical review of major research endeavors that inform our knowledge of risk to communities from shale energy development, while identifying gaps in our understanding of these risks and areas of research need.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es404647x","DOI":"10.1021/es404647x","ISSN":"0013-936X","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

In this experiment, positron emission tomography (PET) data were gathered on participants (N = 28) who solved easy and hard problems that were tailored to the participants' own ability levels, thereby eliminating aptitude group differences in effort requirements. Contrary to previous results, high aptitude was associated with high cortical glucose use. Average aptitude participants showed diminished glucose use in the hard condition. A significant Group X Condition X Hemisphere Effect was also noted, with greater right hemisphere activation in the hard condition for the high-aptitude group.

To characterize the regional socio-economy as an ecosystem, a series of ecological indicators based on cosmic emergy are devised. For a systematic ecological account, cosmic exergy transformities are provided for various dimensions including climate flows, natural resources, industrial products, cultural products, population with educational hierarchy, and environmental emissions. For the urban ecosystem of Beijing in the period from 1990 to 2005, ecological accounting is carried out and characterized in full details. Taking 2000 as the starting point, systems modelling is realized to predict the urban evolution in a one hundred time horizon. For systems regulation, scenario analyses with essential policy-making implications are made to illustrate the long term systems effects of the expected water diversion and rise in energy price.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1007570409005000","DOI":"10.1016/j.cnsns.2009.09.025","ISSN":"1007-5704","journalAbbreviation":"Communications in Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"H."},{"family":"Chen","given":"G.

A comparably brief treatment of the question \"What is operational research?\" is given in Part 2. Operational research is thought to be the latest exemplification of scientific method rather than \"a science\". What is important about operational research is brought out through a description of an actual case study, and some of the activities which look like operational research but are not are mentioned. This leads to an attempted definition of operational research. Part 3 tries to draw the answers to the first two questions together, and to show how operational research and cybernetics are related. It is possible to pursue each activity in its own right; but it is also possible to practise operational research with essentially cybernetic models, and to study cybernetics by operational research techniques. This thought is generalized into the idea that cybernetics is the science of which operational research is the method.","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3007308","DOI":"10.2307/3007308","ISSN":"1473-2858","journalAbbreviation":"OR","author":[{"family":"Beer","given":"Stafford"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1959"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,13]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/P42MIKRW","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/P42MIKRW","type":"chapter","title":"Leibniz’s Quantity of Force: A ‘Heresy’?

The Cartesian quantity of motion refers to what is now called momentum, the Leibnizian quantity of force to the kinetic energy of a moving body. Both quantities are conserved. In fact, it was not that simple. Far from being a “dispute de mots”, the vis viva controversy involved the confrontation with specific ontological presuppositions underlying the physico-philosophical theories of that time.

Many studies present information on these concerns, yet the strength of epidemiological evidence remains tenuous. This paper is a review of the strength of evidence in scientific reporting of environmental hazards from UNGD activities associated with adverse human health outcomes. Studies were drawn from peer-reviewed and grey literature following a systematic search. Five databases were searched for studies published from January 1995 through March 2014 using key search terms relevant to environmental health. Studies were screened, ranked and then reviewed according to the strength of the evidence presented on adverse environmental health outcomes associated with UNGD. The initial searches yielded &gt; 1000 studies, but this was reduced to 109 relevant studies after the ranking process. Only seven studies were considered highly relevant based on strength of evidence. Articles spanned several relevant topics, but most focussed on impacts on typical environmental media, such as water and air, with much of the health impacts inferred rather than evidenced. Additionally, the majority of studies focussed on short-term, rather than long-term, health impacts, which is expected considering the timeframe of UNGD; therefore, very few studies examined health outcomes with longer latencies such as cancer or developmental outcomes. Current scientific evidence for UNGD that demonstrates associations between adverse health outcomes directly with environmental health hazards resulting from UNGD activities generally lacks methodological rigour. Importantly, however, there is also no evidence to rule out such health impacts. While the current evidence in the scientific research reporting leaves questions unanswered about the actual environmental health impacts, public health concerns remain intense. This is a clear gap in the scientific knowledge that requires urgent attention.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969714015290","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.084","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"Environmental health impacts of unconventional natural gas development","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","author":[{"family":"Werner","given":"Angela K."},{"family":"Vink","given":"Sue"},{"family":"Watt","given":"Kerrianne"},{"family":"Jagals","given":"Paul"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,24]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PFS55R96","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PFS55R96","type":"book","title":"The macroscope: A new world scientific system","publisher":"Harper & Row","number-of-pages":"247","edition":"1st","source":"Amazon.com","URL":"http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/macroscope/default.html","ISBN":"0-06-011029-5","shortTitle":"The macroscope","author":[{"family":"Rosnay","given":"Joel","dropping-particle":"de"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1979"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PGBQZIP6","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PGBQZIP6","type":"book","title":"Diagnosing the System for Organizations","publisher":"Wiley","edition":"1","ISBN":"0-471-95136-6","call-number":"0901","author":[{"family":"Beer","given":"Stafford"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",5,16]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PGSX77A5","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PGSX77A5","type":"chapter","title":"State of the Art: Mathematical Approaches in Brain Science","container-title":"A New Foundation for Representation in Cognitive and Brain Science","collection-title":"Springer Series in Cognitive and Neural Systems","collection-number":"7","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","page":"11-32","source":"link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au","abstract":"This chapter explores some of the most relevant mathematical structures used by brain researchers to unravel brain’s structure, function and dynamics. It starts by looking into the concept of brain state. The concept of the state of a system is key in engineering and physics, but maybe it is a not a very well understood concept in other relevant fields of brain science like cognitive psychology. Scientific models and theories of the brain are empirically tested against signal measurements of brain activity. Undoubtedly, the methodology and technology used constrain the possible interpretations of the models. For example, single cell recording typically consists on time series of voltage values that represents spikes or action potentials. Spikes are characterised by two parameters: amplitude and duration. Recording a population of neurons, on the other hand, is far from trivial. The recorded signal is not a point process, rather it represents a summation of several events in the neighborhood of the electrode. Neuroscience constitutes a challenging and promising testing ground for developing our understanding of how the macroscopic level emerges from the interaction of large numbers of interacting components. The functioning of the brain at the high level of mental processing is, of course, expected to be the result of the co-operate action of a very large number of neurons.","URL":"http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-7738-5_2","ISBN":"978-94-007-7737-8","note":"DOI: 10.1007/978-94-007-7738-5_2","shortTitle":"State of the Art","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Gómez-Ramirez","given":"Jaime"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,23]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PGTBPZEK","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PGTBPZEK","type":"book","title":"The Science of Mechanics: A Critical and Historical Account of Its Development","publisher":"Open Court Publishing Company","publisher-place":"LaSalle, Ill.","number-of-pages":"668","edition":"6 edition","source":"Amazon","event-place":"LaSalle, Ill.","ISBN":"978-0-87548-202-6","shortTitle":"The Science of Mechanics","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Mach","given":"Ernst"}],"translator":[{"family":"McCormack","given":"T.

Two different cell populations, immortalized mouse fibroblasts (NIH3T3) and adult human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECad) were selected and seeded in separate polystyrene Petri dishes. Dishes seeded with NIH3T3 were then placed on top of those seeded with HMVECad at distances of 4 mm and 11 mm. A black filter was placed between dishes containing the two cell populations in another experiment, to prevent transmission of electromagnetic radiation between the two. Cell number and morphology of NIH3T3 and endothelial cells were found to be modified in dishes without the black filter, suggesting that specific signals emitted by the cells were transmitted through the polystyrene wall, affecting cell proliferation rate and morphology, even though the cells were growing in separate dishes.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X11000289","DOI":"10.1016/j.semcancer.2011.04.003","ISSN":"1044-579X","shortTitle":"New perspectives in cell communication","journalAbbreviation":"Seminars in Cancer Biology","author":[{"family":"Rossi","given":"C."},{"family":"Foletti","given":"A."},{"family":"Magnani","given":"A."},{"family":"Lamponi","given":"S."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PP3S4JQQ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PP3S4JQQ","type":"article-journal","title":"If I had a rich picture...: insights into the use of \"soft\" methodological tools to support the development of interprofessional education.","container-title":"Journal of Interprofessional Care","page":"488-498","volume":"22","issue":"5","source":"EBSCOhost","abstract":"This paper describes a methodological experiment that aimed to test a small number of tools borrowed from Soft Systems Methodology.

Part of their appeal is the high Energy Return on Energy Investment (EROI) when procuring them. We assessed data from the United States Bureau of the Census of Mineral Industries, the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Oil and Gas Journal for the years 1919–2007 and from oil analyst Jean Laherrere to derive EROI for both finding and producing oil and gas. We found two general patterns in the relation of energy gains compared to energy costs: a gradual secular decrease in EROI and an inverse relation to drilling effort. EROI for finding oil and gas decreased exponentially from 1200:1 in 1919 to 5:1 in 2007. The EROI for production of the oil and gas industry was about 20:1 from 1919 to 1972, declined to about 8:1 in 1982 when peak drilling occurred, recovered to about 17:1 from 1986–2002 and declined sharply to about 11:1 in the mid to late 2000s. The slowly declining secular trend has been partly masked by changing effort: the lower the intensity of drilling, the higher the EROI compared to the secular trend. Fuel consumption within the oil and gas industry grew continuously from 1919 through the early 1980s, declined in the mid-1990s, and has increased recently, not surprisingly linked to the increased cost of finding and extracting oil.","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/3/10/1866","DOI":"10.3390/su3101866","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Guilford","given":"Megan C."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Charles A.

Pressure from urban development, land use and land cover change along the western coast of Taiwan not only has caused the loss of ecosystem services in peri-urban environments, but has also resulted in an increase in urban flooding vulnerability. This paper develops a framework, which incorporates the interaction among exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for assessing the vulnerability to flooding. To achieve this aim, this research interprets urban flooding vulnerability based on emergy concepts and develops emergy indices to assess the spatiality of urban flooding vulnerability in Taiwan's western coastal plain via GIS. Based on the results of the emergy evaluation of the three components of vulnerability and five emergy indices for urban flooding vulnerability, the areas with intense urbanization are characterized with high potential impact to flood. However, cities with higher potential impact do not necessarily lead to higher vulnerability for urban flooding because adaptive capacity can also mitigate the vulnerability of cities to extreme climate events. Using the framework developed by this research we show that the emergy concept can effectively provide a common measuring unit for evaluating exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of urban flooding vulnerability.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204615001292","DOI":"10.1016/j.landurbplan.2015.06.004","ISSN":"0169-2046","journalAbbreviation":"Landscape and Urban Planning","author":[{"family":"Chang","given":"Li-Fang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Shu-Li"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,29]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PTPPAVFV","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PTPPAVFV","type":"book","title":"Environmental economics: the analysis of a major interface","publisher":"Roland Leimgruber","call-number":"0012","shortTitle":"Environmental economics","author":[{"family":"Pillet","given":"G."},{"family":"Murota","given":"T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1987"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PUJ5W57K","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/PUJ5W57K","type":"article-journal","title":"Explanations of ecological relationships with energy systems concepts","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","page":"201-211","volume":"158","issue":"3","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"In order to compare aspects of systems ecology theory, this paper is one of a group by different authors arranged by Sven Jorgensen to explain the quantitative relationships in the same set of recently published papers.

The Norwegian dry gas export system is selected as the subject for the analysis. The gas export system at the Norwegian Continental Shelf is the largest offshore gas transport network in the world, and it consists of many components, such as pipelines, platforms, processing and exit terminals, and many routing possibilities. There are two important factors that a gas export system shall satisfy. First, the system shall secure that the customers receive the gas that they have ordered. Second, the system shall do this in as energy efficient way as possible, i.e., minimize operating costs and environmental emissions. For the operator of gas export systems it is of vital importance that equipments and pipelines in the system are optimally integrated. This will secure flexibility, capability, availability and energy efficiency of the system, and enhance understanding between different system operators. Operational experience shows that there is a substantial need to analyze the integration between the system components and the effects on optimum operation, energy consumption and environmental emissions. The objective of this work is to demonstrate how systems engineering and information models have been applied as tools for analyzing the integration in and overcoming the complexity of gas export systems and system operation, and further for developing models that optimize the energy efficiency of system operation. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Over the years, researchers have been working to prove EmA׳s validity: EmA has been combined with other methodologies or techniques scientifically more consolidated – life cycle assessment, ecological footprint, geographical information systems and strategic environmental assessment; emergy researchers also tried to overcome criticism by clarifying emergy algebra specificities and the relationship between emergy and exergy; different approaches were also used to perform uncertainty analysis on EmA. Despite those efforts, EmA is not as scientifically and technically consolidated as emergy researchers wanted it to be.

It is a graphical representation of the maximal mix of outputs that an economy can achieve using its existing resources to full extent and in the most efficient way.\nIn its microeconomic applications the graph shows the various combinations of amounts of two commodities that an economy can produce per unit of time (such as number of guns vs. kilograms of butter) using a fixed amount of each of the factors of production, given the production technologies available. At the macroeconomic level it can be used to depict other rivalrous trade-offs like production of fixed capital versus production of consumer goods. Graphically bounding the production set for fixed input quantities, the PPF curve shows the maximum possible production level of one commodity for any given production level of the other, given the existing state of technology.\nBy doing so, it defines productive efficiency in the context of that production set: a point on the frontier indicates efficient use of the available inputs, while a point beneath the curve indicates inefficiency. The commodities compared can either be goods or services. The combination represented by the point on the PPF where an efficient economy operates shows the priorities or choices of the economy, such as the choice of producing more capital goods and fewer consumer goods or vice versa.\nPPFs are normally drawn as bulging upwards (\"concave\") from the origin, but they can be represented as bulging downward or linear (straight), depending on a number of factors. A PPF illustrates a number of economic concepts, such as scarcity of resources (the fundamental economic problem that all societies face), opportunity cost (or marginal rate of transformation), productive efficiency, allocative efficiency, and economies of scale.\nAn outward shift of the PPF results from growth of the availability of inputs such as physical capital or labour or technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.\nHowever, most economic contractions reflect not that less can be produced but that the economy has started operating below the frontier: typically both labor and physical capital are underemployed.","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Production%E2%80%93possibility_frontier&oldid=707720419","note":"Page Version ID: 707720419","language":"en","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,8]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/Q82MCBSB","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/Q82MCBSB","type":"article-journal","title":"Dynamic emergy accounting of water and carbon ecosystem services: A model to simulate the impacts of land-use change","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","collection-title":"Environmental Accounting: Emergy, Systems Ecology and Ecological Modelling","page":"113-131","volume":"271","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"Expansion of agriculture over ecosystem areas is widely recognized as one of the most significant human alterations to the global environment over the last century. Although food and fiber production are essential ecosystem services (ES) to humankind, the clearing of forests for agricultural use is associated with changes in land cover which affect a wide range of ES at local, regional and global scales. Considering the importance of climate change, freshwater scarcity, soil erosion and other environmental issues, this paper aims to simulate the impact of land-use change on the ecosystem services related to water and carbon biogeochemical processes. The system under study is the Taquarizinho river basin, located in the eastern region of Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, inserted in the upland borders of one of the largest wetland systems of the world, the Pantanal. Formerly occupied by Brazilian savannah (Cerrado), more than half of Taquarizinho watershed was converted both to agriculture and pasture lands since the 1960s. In order to quantify the impact of land-use change on ES provided by Taquarizinho over the years, this paper introduces the hydro-carbon model, which dynamically represents ecosystem services related to water and carbon cycles, such as canal discharge, groundwater recharge, evapotranspiration, biomass carbon sequestration, litter carbon sequestration, and soil carbon sequestration. The hydro-carbon model uses emergy for estimating the monetary value of ecosystem services provided by the river basin under different land-use scenarios. In this paper, extreme scenarios represent typical land-use types in Taquarizinho basin: native savanna (NS), agroforestry systems (AF), conventional tillage agriculture (CT), no-tillage multiple cropping agriculture (NT), degraded pastures (DP), and pastures under improved management (IP). Results in this paper reveal a hierarchy related to water and carbon ES provision, in descending order: native savanna (247 EM$ ha−1 y−1), agroforestry system (204 EM$ ha−1 y−1), pastures under improved management (180 EM$ ha−1 y−1), no-tillage multiple cropping agriculture (160 EM$ ha−1 y−1), degraded pastures (104 EM$ ha−1 y−1) and conventional tillage agriculture (75 EM$ ha−1 y−1).","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380013001555","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.03.006","ISSN":"0304-3800","shortTitle":"Dynamic emergy accounting of water and carbon ecosystem services","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Watanabe","given":"Marcos D.

The energetic evolution of mind is described as a natural self-referential exteriorization of the algorithmic organization of consciousness in the form of culturally shared mental models. It is proposed that the brain-mind energy relationship has historically undergone and continues to undergo change, and that this change is a natural thermodynamic arrow that constitutes the evolution of culture. That is, the evolution of culture proceeds in the direction of progressively more complete and efficient exteriorizations of the algorithmic organization of the brain-thus, for example, the recent evolution of brain-like computing systems and virtual reality systems. Accordingly, an uneven, but closing, central-energy-state identity (self-similarity) between brain and mind is described.

All ecosystems in the landscapes are associated with energy transformation and the convergence of transformed products toward higher hierarchical levels, the recycling of materials to dispersed backgrounds, and feedbacks to reinforce the supporting environment. A hierarchy can be seen as an organized pattern with many small units at one level contributing to fewer units at the next higher level. Due to spatial variability in the natural environment, different types and amounts of energy received on the earth are not homogeneous; this in turn generates a heterogeneous pattern on the landscape. Energy from life-support and production systems of a heterogeneous landscape is transformed and converged spatially toward consumption centers. All energy transformation can be arranged in a series. The concept of transformity is used in this paper to indicate the position of an energy flow in the series. A hierarchical system can help to explain how energy and matter can be produced and recycled through each level of energy transfer. Building on the brief reviews of the concept of hierarchy in the landscape and the theoretical development of the concept of an ecological energetic hierarchy, this paper proposes two principles of energetic hierarchy for landscape sustainability. First, the landscape must be arranged spatially according to its energy hierarchy. Evaluation of normalized energy flows (emergy) can help identify zones of different spatial hierarchies, which will help establish the strategies needed for the landscapes to be sustainable. Second, a sustainable landscape must comprise a hierarchy of self-organizing ecosystems that can enable the systems to maximize useful power at all levels of the energy hierarchy.","URL":"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-012-9706-7","DOI":"10.1007/s10980-012-9706-7","ISSN":"0921-2973, 1572-9761","journalAbbreviation":"Landscape Ecol","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Ying-Chieh"},{"family":"Yeh","given":"Chia-Tsung"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Shu-Li"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",1,19]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,9]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/QU69NFZZ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/QU69NFZZ","type":"webpage","title":"International Society for Digital Earth","URL":"http://www.digitalearth-isde.org/","author":[{"literal":"ISDE"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/QUI97WVS","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/QUI97WVS","type":"book","title":"The ecological approach to visual perception","publisher":"Lawrence Erlbaum Associates","publisher-place":"Hillsdale  N.J.","event-place":"Hillsdale  N.J.","ISBN":"978-0-89859-958-9","call-number":"0000","author":[{"family":"Gibson","given":"James"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1986"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/QUTSPVGW","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/QUTSPVGW","type":"article-journal","title":"Photosynthesis and negative entropy production","container-title":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Bioenergetics","page":"251-255","volume":"1709","issue":"3","abstract":"The widely held view that the maximum efficiency of a photosynthetic pigment system is given by the Carnot cycle expression (1 - T/Tr) for energy transfer from a hot bath (radiation at temperature Tr) to a cold bath (pigment system at temperature T) is critically examined and demonstrated to be inaccurate when the entropy changes associated with the microscopic process of photon absorption and photochemistry at the level of single photosystems are considered. This is because entropy losses due to excited state generation and relaxation are extremely small ([Delta]S << T/Tr) and are essentially associated with the absorption-fluorescence Stokes shift. Total entropy changes associated with primary photochemistry for single photosystems are shown to depend critically on the thermodynamic efficiency of the process. This principle is applied to the case of primary photochemistry of the isolated core of higher plant photosystem I and photosystem II, which are demonstrated to have maximal thermodynamic efficiencies of [xi] > 0.98 and [xi] > 0.92 respectively, and which, in principle, function with negative entropy production. It is demonstrated that for the case of [xi] > (1 - T/Tr) entropy production is always negative and only becomes positive when [xi] < (1 - T/Tr).","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T1S-4GYH6KH-3/2/9c5b839bf47c53fab96df065957fa598","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbabio.2005.08.004","call-number":"0009","author":[{"family":"Jennings","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Engelmann","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Garlaschi","given":"Flavio"},{"family":"Casazza","given":"Anna Paola"},{"family":"Zucchelli","given":"Giuseppe"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",9,30]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,28]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/QVQ7QSJQ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/QVQ7QSJQ","type":"book","title":"Leibniz's Philosophy of Logic and Language","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","number-of-pages":"264","source":"Google Books","abstract":"This is the second edition of an important introduction to Leibniz's philosophy of logic and language first published in 1972.

Of course, the tools only make it possible for engineers who understand requirements engineering to do a better job. This book goes a long way towards building a foundational set of skills in requirements engineering, so that today's powerful tools can be used sensibly. Of particular value is a recognition of the place software requirements have within the system context, and of ways for dealing with that sensitive connection. This is an important book.

It serves different purposes; an important one is to improve the public risk awareness and mitigation. Because of the strong spatio-temporal component of natural hazards, maps can play a decisive role in communicating risk information. The application and design of maps for risk communication especially to the public has not been investigated comprehensively. Specific constraints and challenges of risk communication have not been considered systematically in the map design process so far. This study aims at developing a frame for the application and design of interactive risk and hazard maps for the public which is based on the specific constraints and challenges of risk communication. In a literature review it introduces concepts and methods from social sciences and psychology, which have been assessed as important for communicating risk information. The concepts and methods are adapted to map-mediated risk communication according to the approaches of Activity Theory. Communication objectives and tasks which are essential to improve risk mitigation are identified and geovisualization methods for information presentation are related according to the degree which they are able to serve them. Based on this, some principles for map-based risk communication are established.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538941003774668","DOI":"10.1080/17538941003774668","ISSN":"1753-8947","author":[{"family":"Dransch","given":"Doris"},{"family":"Rotzoll","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Poser","given":"Kathrin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RD3A3QIP","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RD3A3QIP","type":"article-journal","title":"Embodied energy, foreign trade, and welfare of nations","container-title":"Integration of Economy and Ecology, University of Stockholm Press, Stockholm","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"HT"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1984"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RDE4C8P5","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RDE4C8P5","type":"book","title":"Quantifying sustainable development : the future of tropical economies","publisher":"Academic Press","publisher-place":"San Diego","event-place":"San Diego","ISBN":"978-0-12-318861-8","call-number":"0046","shortTitle":"Quantifying sustainable development","author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Charles"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RDRDB92E","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RDRDB92E","type":"book","title":"A dictionary of political thought","publisher":"Pan","publisher-place":"London","volume":"2","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-330-28099-0","call-number":"0301","author":[{"family":"Scruton","given":"Roger"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1983"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RE2RGGMN","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RE2RGGMN","type":"article-journal","title":"Fluorescence stopped-flow study of relaxation processes in the binding of bilirubin to serum albumins","container-title":"Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics","page":"106-112","volume":"160","issue":"1","abstract":"Bilirubin binding to albumins of different species has been studied with stopped-flow measurements of protein fluorescence quenching and the appearance of bilirubin fluorescence. Binding, itself, as indicated by quenching of protein fluorescence, occurs at an immeasurably fast rate. The visible fluorescence of bilirubin, however, appears more slowly. The development of this fluorescence is a first-order process with a half-time of 50-100 msec, depending on the species of albumin, and may be related to the relaxation of bilirubin to a helical conformation. A slower secondary quenching of protein fluorescence occurs after the initial quenching associated with binding itself. The secondary process reduces the already quenched fluorescence by another 50%, is a first-order reaction, and has a half-time of 300-400 msec. From energy transfer calculations, a 4 � migration of bound bilirubin along the albumin binding crevice toward tryptophans could account for this degree of secondary quenching, but a protein conformational change is not ruled out. Multiple relaxation processes in macromolecular binding may prove to be rather general phenomena.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6WB5-4KBC36J-F/2/8d6899da2c9db2e6fe0c7d9a7cef915c","DOI":"10.1016/S0003-9861(74)80014-7","call-number":"0071","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Raymond F."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1974",1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",8,17]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/REAJGS9H","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/REAJGS9H","type":"book","title":"Leibniz: a biography","publisher":"Cambridge Univ Press","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=7228136","shortTitle":"Leibniz","author":[{"family":"Aiton","given":"Eric J."},{"family":"Lanas","given":"Cristina Corredor"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1985"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,30]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RET48QBP","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RET48QBP","type":"article-journal","title":"Rebuttal of “Economic value of natural coastal wetlands: A critique”","container-title":"Coastal Zone Management Journal","page":"231-237","volume":"5","issue":"3","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08920757909361808","DOI":"10.1080/08920757909361808","ISSN":"0090-8339","shortTitle":"Rebuttal of “Economic value of natural coastal wetlands","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"Eugene P."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1979",1,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,25]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RFGM9N4U","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RFGM9N4U","type":"article","title":"MMSD+10: Reflecting on a decade of mining and sustainable development","publisher":"International Institute for Environment and Development","URL":"http://pubs.iied.org/pdfs/16041IIED.pdf?","author":[{"family":"Buxton, Abbi","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RFS4UEZE","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RFS4UEZE","type":"book","title":"ELECTRONICS: Experimental Techniques","publisher":"McGraw-Hill Book Company, Inc.","call-number":"0021","shortTitle":"ELECTRONICS","author":[{"family":"Elmore","given":"William C.

The purpose of this article is to provide a critical review of the Queensland regulatory approach to the approval and minimisation of adverse impacts from coal seam gas activities. Following an overview of the hallmarks of an effective adaptive management approach, this article begins by addressing the mosaic of approval processes and impact assessment regimes that may apply to coal seam gas projects. This includes recent Strategic Cropping Land reforms. This article then turns to consider the preconditions for land access in Queensland and the emerging issues for landholders relating to the negotiation of access and compensation agreements. This article then undertakes a critical review of the environmental duties imposed on coal seam gas operators relating to hydraulic fracturing, well head leaks, groundwater management and the disposal and beneficial use of produced water. Finally, conclusions are drawn regarding the overall effectiveness of the Queensland framework and the lessons that may be drawn from Queensland’s adaptive environmental management approach.","URL":"http://eprints.qut.edu.au/49293/","ISSN":"0813-300X","shortTitle":"Regulating coal seam gas in Queensland","author":[{"family":"Swayne","given":"Nicola"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",1,27]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RPR4TGUF","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RPR4TGUF","type":"book","title":"The Fabric of the Cosmos","publisher":"Alfred A.

The cellular uptake of free bilirubin is rapid, being complete in 10 minutes or less following its addition to a cell suspension. Increasing bilirubin concentration increased cell death; there is a lag phase at all concentrations tested, inversely proportional to the concentration of the bile pigment seen with this effect on viability. Cytotoxicity increased at pH 7.6 and below. Albumin-bound bilirubin was nontoxic to tissue culture cells. Albumin added to bilirubin-treated cells resulted in extraction of significant quantities of the cellular-bound bilirubin. However, even when the albumin was added as rapidly as 1 minute after the bilirubin to cells there was still some loss in cell viability. Uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and inhibitors of NADH oxidase activity, unlike bilirubin, neither decreased cell viability nor brought about the loss of soluble proteins from cells. Bilirubin more closely resembled agents such as deoxycholate that affect cell membranes in bringing about the loss of cellular proteins. The suggestion is made that the electron-transport lesion induced by bilirubin may not in itself bring about cell death, but that the primary lethal lesion may be on multiple cell membrane systems, perhaps brought about by some alteration of membrane lipids.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B7G7P-4KK2RRS-2/2/019686a17321e6959a26b8f4189b44b8","DOI":"10.1016/0006-2944(71)90069-X","call-number":"0059","shortTitle":"Mechanism of bilirubin toxicity on tissue culture cells","author":[{"family":"Cowger","given":"Marilyn L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1971",2]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",8,17]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RT8N9GF3","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RT8N9GF3","type":"article","title":"DMP Response to Report: ‘Regulation of Shale, Coal Seam and Tight Gas Activities in Western Australia'","publisher":"Government of Western Australia, Department of Mines and Petroleum","URL":"http://www.dmp.wa.gov.au/documents/DMP_Response_to_Report.pdf","author":[{"family":"DMP","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RTK88AHF","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RTK88AHF","type":"article-journal","title":"The Shale Oil and Gas Revolution, Hydraulic Fracturing, and Water Contamination: A Regulatory Strategy","container-title":"Columbia Law and Economics Working Paper","issue":"440","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2221025","shortTitle":"The Shale Oil and Gas Revolution, Hydraulic Fracturing, and Water Contamination","author":[{"family":"Merrill","given":"Thomas W."},{"family":"Schizer","given":"David"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,4]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RTUZV39F","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RTUZV39F","type":"webpage","title":"Groundwater Systems Research","container-title":"Institute for Future Environments; Science and Engineering Faculty","genre":"research-project","abstract":"The Groundwater Systems Research (GSR) program provides:a focus for groundwater researchmultidisciplinary expertise and applicationsopportunities f...","URL":"https://www.qut.edu.au/research/research-projects/groundwater-systems-research","author":[{"literal":"QUT"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RURH7VUV","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RURH7VUV","type":"article-journal","title":"An adaptive management framework for connected groundwater-surface water resources in Australia","container-title":"Bureau of Rural Sciences, Canberra","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Baskaran_Sundaram/publication/265158256_An_Adaptive_Management_Framework_for_Connected_Groundwater-Surface_Water_Resources_in_Australia/links/55388abc0cf226723ab6306b.pdf","author":[{"family":"Brodie","given":"Ross"},{"family":"Sundaram","given":"Baskaran"},{"family":"Tottenham","given":"Robyn"},{"family":"Hostetler","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Ransley","given":"Tim"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RVC2GFNP","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/RVC2GFNP","type":"article-journal","title":"Measuring the sustainability of policy scenarios: Emergy-based strategic environmental assessment of the Chinese paper industry","container-title":"Ecological Complexity","collection-title":"Eco Summit 2007 Special Issue, Part Two","page":"156-161","volume":"7","issue":"2","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"Recent years have seen increasing demand for wider application of strategic environmental assessment (SEA), especially SEA of major policies, as a powerful instrument to safeguard the environment during the rapid industrialization and urbanization in China.

It was developed over 100�years ago by the Irish engineer Riall Sankey to analyze the thermal efficiency of steam engines and has since been applied to depict the energy and material balances of complex systems. The Sankey diagram is the main tool for visualizing industrial metabolism and hence is widely used in industrial ecology. In the history of the early 20th century, it played a major role when raw materials were scarce and expensive and engineers were making great efforts to improve technical systems. Sankey diagrams can also be used to map value flows in systems at the operational level or along global value chains. The article charts the historical development of the diagrams. After the First World War the diagrams were used to produce thermal balances of production plants for glass and cement and to optimize the energy input. In the 1930s, steel and iron ore played a strategic role in Nazi Germany. Their efficient use was highlighted with Sankey diagrams. Since the 1990s, these diagrams have become common for displaying data in life cycle assessments (LCAs) of products. Sankey diagrams can also be used to map value flows in systems at the operational level or along global value added chains. This article, the first of a pair, charts the historical development.

This at a time when many are struggling to deal with half a century of legacy data infrastructure since the International Geophysical Year. While data management best practice has evolved over this time, large-scale migration activities are rare, with processes and applications instead built up around a plethora of different technologies and approaches. It is perhaps more important than ever, before embarking on major investments in new technologies, to consider the benefits first of 'catching up' with mature best-practice. Data warehousing, as an architectural formalism, was developed in the 1990s as a response to the growing challenges in corporate environments of assembling, integrating, and quality controlling large amounts of data from multiple sources and for multiple purposes. A layered\narchitecture separates transactional data, integration and staging areas, the warehouse itself, and analytical 'data marts', with optimised ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes used to promote data through the layers. The data warehouse, together with associated techniques of 'master data management' and 'business intelligence', provides a classic foundation for 'enterprise information management' (\"an integrative discipline for structuring, describing and governing information assets across organizational and technological boundaries to improve\nefficiency, promote transparency and enable business insight\", Gartner). The Australian Bureau of Meteorology, like most Earth-science agencies, maintains a large amount of observation data in a variety of systems and architectures. These data assets evolve over decades, usually for operational, rather than information management, reasons. Consequently there can be inconsistency in architectures and technologies. We describe our experience with two major data assets: the Australian Water Resource Information System (AWRIS) and the Australian Data Archive for Meteorology (ADAM). These maintain the national archive of hydrological and climate data. We are undertaking a migration of AWRIS from a 'software-centric' system to a 'data-centric' warehouse, with\nsignificant benefits in performance, scalability, and maintainability. As well, the architecture supports the use of conventional BI tools for product development and visualisation. We have also experimented with a warehouse ETL replacement for custom tsunameter ingest code in ADAM, with considerable success. Our experience suggests that there is benefit to be gained through adoption by science agencies of professional IT best practice that is mature in industry but may have been overlooked by scientific information practitioners. In the case of data warehousing, the practice requires a change of perspective from a focus on code development to a focus on data. It will continue to be relevant in the 'digital age' as vendors increasingly support integrated warehousing and 'big data' platforms.","URL":"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015EGUGA..1714909M","shortTitle":"Something old, something new","author":[{"family":"Maguire","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Woolf","given":"Andrew"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,8]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/SIH4Q5C3","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/SIH4Q5C3","type":"book","title":"Tao : the watercourse way","publisher":"Arkana","publisher-place":"London","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-14-019254-4","call-number":"0161","author":[{"family":"Watts","given":"Alan"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1992"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/SIIFKHCA","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/SIIFKHCA","type":"article-journal","title":"On the Second-Law inconsistency of Emergy Analysis","container-title":"Energy","page":"3696-3706","volume":"35","issue":"9","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"The paper argues against the claim made by Emergy Analysts that emergy is an exergy-based procedure. Both Emergy- and Exergy Analysis employ space- and time integrated energy input/output models to quantitatively assess the resource consumption of physical systems: the issue at stake is whether Emergy is embodied energy or embodied exergy. Although the compatibility of Exergy- and Emergy accounting procedures, the significance of the peculiar Emergy Algebra, and some cost-allocation issues have been studied in detail, a final agreement could not be reached, so that some doubt exists about the degree of compatibility of the two methods. The present paper shows that the definitions and the procedures employed in Emergy Analysis are in fact First Law-based, and that they neglect or misrepresent Second Law issues. This conclusion is reached by carefully reviewing and critically analyzing a series of general and specific procedures contained in the original Odum books and in some of the most representative publications by Emergy analysts.\n\nThe conclusions are that Emergy Analysis is a cumulative energy cost accounting method, and that therefore the claim that “emergy is embodied exergy” is not congruent with the methods adopted by Emergy Analysts in their studies, because the subsumed theory does not contain any consistent feature that allows it to treat fluxes with exergy factors different than unity.\n\nIt is recommended therefore that Emergy Analysis be not used to assess the global resource consumption caused by anthropic activities, because its results are misleading when it comes to estimate the exergy destruction enacted by real industrial transformations. For this kind of analyses, genuinely Second Law-based methods are the only ones to date that lead to a correct assessment of the real exergy resource use “embodied” in a commodity. It must be stressed that the arguments put forth in this paper do not deny the validity of Emergy Analysis per se: they simply disprove the claim that Emergy is a “Second Law-based method”.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544210002781","DOI":"10.1016/j.energy.2010.05.015","ISSN":"0360-5442","journalAbbreviation":"Energy","author":[{"family":"Sciubba","given":"Enrico"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,14]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/SIWJ48Q9","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/SIWJ48Q9","type":"chapter","title":"Lecture II: What pragmatism means","container-title":"Pragmatism: A new name for some old ways of thinking","publisher":"Longmans, Green and Co","publisher-place":"New York, NY, US","page":"43-81","source":"APA PsycNET","event-place":"New York, NY, US","abstract":"The meaning of pragmatism is discussed. The pragmatic method is primarily a method of settling metaphysical disputes that otherwise might be interminable. This method tries to interpret such notions as determinism versus freedom and materialism versus spiritualism by tracing their practical consequences. What difference would it practically make to any one if this notion rather than that notion were true? If no practical difference whatever can be traced, then the alternatives mean practically the same thing, and all dispute is idle. The history of the method and its character and affinities are discussed, as well as how it contrasts with rationalism and intellectualism. The word pragmatism has come to be used in a wider sense, as meaning also a certain theory of truth. In this sense, pragmatism is equivalent to humanism, which views truth as giving human satisfaction in marrying previous parts of experience with newer parts. As a mediator between empiricism and rationalism, pragmatism has no prejudices, no obstructive dogmas, and no rigid canons of what shall count as proof. Rationalism sticks to logic and the empyrean. Empiricism sticks to the external senses. Pragmatism is willing to take anything, to follow either logic or the senses and to count the humblest and most personal experiences. Its only test of probable truth is what fits every part of life best and combines with the collectivity of experience's demands, nothing being omitted.","shortTitle":"Lecture II","author":[{"family":"James","given":"William"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1907"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/SMPI2675","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/SMPI2675","type":"article-journal","title":"The Cybernetic Nature of Ecosystems","container-title":"The American Naturalist","page":"886-895","volume":"118","issue":"6","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/2460822","ISSN":"00030147","call-number":"0098","note":"ArticleType: primary_article / Full publication date: Dec., 1981 / Copyright © 1981 The University of Chicago Press","author":[{"family":"Patten","given":"Bernard C."},{"family":"Odum","given":"Eugene P."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1981",12]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,3]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/SPJSH7ZG","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/SPJSH7ZG","type":"article-journal","title":"Social License and Environmental Protection: Why Businesses Go beyond Compliance","container-title":"Law & Social Inquiry","page":"307-341","volume":"29","issue":"2","source":"JSTOR","abstract":"This article examines the concept of the corporate \"social license,\" which governs the extent to which a corporation is constrained to meet societal expectations and avoid activities that societies (or influential elements within them) deem unacceptable, whether or not those expectations are embodied in law.

Eighty-one UC patients were recruited at all stages of the disease process. Following completion of a 7 d diet diary, clinical assessment including a sigmoidoscopic examination (scale 0 (normal mucosa) to 6 (very active disease)) was conducted. Food weights for each person were adjusted (divided) by the person's calorific intake for the week. Each food consumed was given a food sigmoidoscopy score (FSS) calculated by summing the products of the (adjusted) weight of food consumed and sigmoidoscopy score for each patient and occurrence of food and dividing by the total (adjusted) weight of the food consumed by all 81 patients. Thus, foods eaten in large quantities by patients with very active disease have high FSSs and vice versa. Foods consumed by <10 people or weighing <1 kg for the whole group were excluded, leaving 75 foods.\nRESULTS: High FSS foods were characterized by high levels of the anti-thiamin additive sulfite (Mann-Whitney, p < 0.001), i.e. bitter, white wine, burgers, soft drinks from concentrates, sausages, lager and red wine. Caffeine also has anti-thiamin properties and decaffeinated coffee was associated with a better clinical state than the caffeine containing version.

The anger control variable predicted wound repair over and above differences in hostility, negative affectivity, social support, and health behaviors. Furthermore, participants with lower levels of anger control exhibited higher cortisol reactivity during the blistering procedure. This enhanced cortisol secretion was in turn related to longer time to heal. These findings suggest that the ability to regulate the expression of one’s anger has a clinically relevant impact on wound healing.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159107002644","DOI":"10.1016/j.bbi.2007.10.013","ISSN":"0889-1591","journalAbbreviation":"Brain, Behavior, and Immunity","author":[{"family":"Gouin","given":"Jean-Philippe"},{"family":"Kiecolt-Glaser","given":"Janice K."},{"family":"Malarkey","given":"William B."},{"family":"Glaser","given":"Ronald"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",7]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/T8G284AN","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/T8G284AN","type":"entry-encyclopedia","title":"Reactive programming","container-title":"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","source":"Wikipedia","abstract":"In computing, reactive programming is a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of change.

Ecological risk assessment (ERA), which is aimed at appraising a wide range of undesirable impacts on ecosystems exposed to a possible eco-environmental hazard, has been highly recommended for environmental decision-making. The existing system-based eco-risk models at different levels of hierarchical organization are reviewed, including food web-based models, ecosystem-based models and socio-ecological models are reviewed. Based on this inspection, an integrated framework characterizing problem formulation, risk characterization and risk assessment is depicted to illumine future ecological risk assessments. The possibility of integrating the various ERA modeling systems is addressed through examining the interconnections between models shown within the context of our diagrams. Furthermore, some refinements of the current system-level techniques are proposed to meet the requirements of risk evaluation in a holistic and regulatory context. We conclude that assessing ecological risk by using system-based models at different levels of organization in a combined way is an evolutionary step for the application of risk evaluation in environmental management.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380012005170","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2012.10.015","ISSN":"0304-3800","shortTitle":"Ecological risk assessment on the system scale","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Shaoqing"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Fath","given":"Brian D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",2,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,15]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/TAPC72HC","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/TAPC72HC","type":"article-journal","title":"A Framework for Migrating Relational Datasets to NoSQL1","container-title":"Procedia Computer Science","collection-title":"International Conference On Computational Science, ICCS 2015 Computational Science at the Gates of Nature","page":"2593-2602","volume":"51","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"In software development, migration from a Data Base Management System (DBMS) to another, especially with distinct characteristics, is a challenge for programmers and database administrators.

However, the ability of markets to motivate the supply of carbon sequestration and biodiversity services from agricultural land is uncertain, especially given the future changes in environmental, economic, and social drivers. We quantified the potential supply of these services from the intensive agricultural land of Australia from 2013 to 2050 under four global outlooks in response to a carbon price and biodiversity payment scheme. Each global outlook specified emissions pathways, climate, food demand, energy price, and carbon price modeled using the Global Integrated Assessment Model (GIAM). Using a simplified version of the Land Use Trade-Offs (LUTO) model, economic returns to agriculture, carbon plantings, and environmental plantings were calculated each year. The supply of carbon sequestration and biodiversity services was then quantified given potential land use change under each global outlook, and the sensitivity of the results to key parameters was assessed. We found that carbon supply curves were similar across global outlooks. Sharp increases in carbon sequestration supply occurred at carbon prices exceeding 50 $ tCO2−1 in 2015 and exceeding 65 $ tCO2−1 in 2050. Based on GIAM-modeled carbon prices, little carbon sequestration was expected at 2015 under any global outlook. However, at 2050 expected carbon supply under each outlook differed markedly, ranging from 0 to 189 MtCO2 yr−1. Biodiversity services of 3.32% of the maximum may be achieved in 2050 for a 1 $B investment under median scenario settings. We conclude that a carbon market can motivate supply of substantial carbon sequestration but only modest amounts of biodiversity services from agricultural land. A complementary biodiversity payment can synergistically increase the supply of biodiversity services but will not provide much additional carbon sequestration. The results were sensitive to global drivers, especially the carbon price, and the domestic drivers of adoption hurdle rate and agricultural productivity. The results can inform the design of an effective national policy and institutional portfolio addressing the dual objectives of climate change and biodiversity conservation that is robust to future uncertainty in both national and global drivers.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001186","DOI":"10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.06.013","ISSN":"0959-3780","journalAbbreviation":"Global Environmental Change","author":[{"family":"Bryan","given":"B.

Shortly after manufacture began, workers at all three plants began to become floridly psychotic and die. A moratorium on TEL production was put into place, but was lifted in 1926. Between 1926 and 1965, the prevailing consensus was that lead toxicity occurred only at high levels of exposure and that lead in the atmosphere was harmless. Most of the data on lead toxicity issued from a single source, the Kettering Laboratory in Cincinnati. In 1959, the first warnings of adverse health effects of lead at silent doses were raised by Clair Patterson, a geochemist. In hearings before the Senate Committee on Public Works, Senator Edward Muskie raised the question of adverse health effects from airborne lead. As new data accumulated on health effects of lead at lower doses, the movement to remove lead from gasoline gained momentum, and the Environmental Protection Agency examined the question. The removal of lead would take place over the next 25 years, and its accomplishment would require a severe change in the federal stance regarding its hazard. This article details the interaction of various forces, industrial, regulatory, judicial, public health, and public interest, that were engaged in this contest and estimates the value of this step.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935100940696","DOI":"10.1006/enrs.2000.4069","ISSN":"0013-9351","shortTitle":"The Removal of Lead from Gasoline","journalAbbreviation":"Environmental Research","author":[{"family":"Needleman","given":"Herbert L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",9]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,19]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/TI5TITKP","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/TI5TITKP","type":"book","title":"Incredible Chord Finder - 6 inch. x 9 inch.

The emergy indices for a given system are shown to be functions of renewable, nonrenewable and purchased emergy inflows. Indices are given for several ecological engineering activities including oil spill restoration, land reclamation and wastewater recycle through wetlands, several production systems, and several national economies to demonstrate their usefulness. Ecological engineering involves both natural and engineered systems and the flows of renewable and nonrenewable energy, the appropriate amounts of which are important to determine if they are to result in sustainable use of resources. The sustainability index can be used to evaluate appropriate nonrenewable investments in eco-technology to maximize their performance. Sustainability of economies is shown to be a function of the net yield of the economy and its ‘load' on the environment. The trends of these indices can be monitored over time and provide useful information about the dynamics of economic systems within the carrying capacity of the environment in which they develop.

This pattern of abnormal hepatic enhancement represents a potential pitfall in the use of dynamic bolus-enhanced CT for the detection of focal hepatic masses.

This near-ubiquity, occurring despite the potentially deleterious effects of insertional mutagenesis, raises the possibility that a counterbalancing benefit exists for the host. Such a benefit may act at the population level to generate genomic diversity within a species and hence greater adaptability under new selective pressures, or at the level of primary gain for the individual. Recent studies have highlighted the occurrence of retrotransposition events in the germline and discovered a surprisingly high rate of mobilization in somatic cells.

The expectation is that the “simpler” the networks, the better the generalization on test data (→ Occam's razor). Previous implementations, however, use measures for “simplicity” that lack the power, universality and elegance of those based on Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff's algorithmic probability. Likewise, most previous approaches (especially those of the “Bayesian” kind) suffer from the problem of choosing appropriate priors. This paper addresses both issues. It first reviews some basic concepts of algorithmic complexity theory relevant to machine learing, and how the Solomonoff-Levin distribution (or universal prior) deals with the prior problem. The universal prior leads to a probabilistic method for finding “algorithmically simple” problem solutions with high generalization capability. The method is based on Levin complexity (a time-bounded generalization of Kolmogorov complexity) and inspired by Levin's optimal universal search algorithm. For a given problem, solution candidates are computed by efficient “self-sizing” programs that influence their own runtime and storage size. The probabilistic search algorithm finds the “good” programs (the ones quickly computing algorithmically probable solutions fitting the training data). Simulations focus on the task of discovering “algorithmically simple” neural networks with low Kolmogorov complexity and high generalization capability. It is demonstrated that the method, at least with certain toy problems where it is computationally feasible, can lead to generalization results unmatchable by previous neural network algorithms. Much remains to be done, however, to make large scale applications and “incremental learning” feasible. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089360809600127X","DOI":"10.1016/S0893-6080(96)00127-X","ISSN":"0893-6080","journalAbbreviation":"Neural Networks","author":[{"family":"Schmidhuber","given":"Jürgen"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",7]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,24]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/U83B2R62","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/U83B2R62","type":"article-journal","title":"Quantitative Risk Assessment on Safety and Reliability of Casing Strength for Oil and Gas Wells","container-title":"Energy Procedia","collection-title":"2012 International Conference on Future Electrical Power and Energy System","page":"429-435","volume":"17, Part A","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"A quantitative risk assessment method of casing collapse resistance and internal pressure resistance is established in accordance with the theory of structural reliability and random theory, in terms of geometrical parameters, mechanical property and external load randomness of casing and on the basis of the analysis on shortcomings of safety coefficient and assessment methods for conventional casing design.

Nowadays one of the most important challenges facing ultra large scale systems is the interoperability of their component systems. Interoperability is the ability by which system elements can exchange and understand the information required with each other. This paper aims to solve the mentioned challenge, which is divided into two main parts. In the first part, this paper presents a maturity model for the interoperability of ultra large scale systems, by using the interoperability level of the component system of one ultra large scale system its maturity level can be determined.

A practical approach for demonstrating the environmental sustainability of an action (e.g., green business practice) through ecosystem service analysis is presented. The overarching premise of the approach is that human well-being is directly related to changes in ecosystems and associated services. The approach evaluates the net change in ecosystem services, and hence human well-being, and is termed a net ecosystem service analysis (NESA). Using this approach, if a net positive change in ecosystem services relative to the baseline condition occurs for an action, that action would be considered potentially sustainable. In addition, if an action creates net ecosystem service value above the baseline condition, it would be considered to embody environmental stewardship. Established ecological and human use quantification methods are incorporated into the analysis. In addition, to demonstrate potential sustainability, the approach must also consider the need to satisfy intergenerational equity objectives. The use of a practical approach from which private business and government representatives can make decisions regarding environmental sustainability and stewardship will provide for improved decision-making based on quantifiable metrics.","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/5/5/2152","DOI":"10.3390/su5052152","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Nicolette","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Burr","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Rockel","given":"Mark"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,25]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UD3GM96F","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UD3GM96F","type":"book","title":"Accelerated C++: Practical Programming by Example","publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","publisher-place":"Boston, MA","number-of-pages":"352","edition":"1 edition","source":"Amazon.com","event-place":"Boston, MA","abstract":"Want to learn how to program in C++ immediately?

Google Earth uses Keyhole Markup Language (KML) for modeling and storing geographic features and information for display in the Google Earth Client. This paper will analyze the potential of this novel and free geographic mapping service to reduce embodied energy of transportation in two ways. First, at the consumer level, Google Earth will be studied to map the automobile route that uses the least fuel and maintains vehicle velocities at their individual maximum fuel efficiency. The same analysis for single destination trips could be used to optimize fleet vehicle routes such as garbage or recycling collection trucks. The secondary benefit of ecological education will also be explored. Fuel used could be converted into monetary units based on the current price of gas, pollution/greenhouse gas emissions, or ecological footprints to improve driving habits. Secondly, KML overlays will be analyzed for use of determining: (i) raw material and products availability as a function of location, and (ii) modes of transportation as a function of emissions. These overlays would enable manufacturers access to an easily navigable method to optimize the life cycle of their products by minimizing embodied energy of transportation.

This same tool would be useful for architects to obtain Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating points for the green design of buildings. Overall, the analysis completed finds that the flexibility and visual display of quantitative information made available by Google Earth could have a significant impact at conserving fuel resources by reducing the embodied energy of transportation on a global scale.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VDX-4MFKD8J-1/1/e6aea3f29d5f91e30a8bf3fb7fd57b17","DOI":"10.1016/j.resconrec.2006.10.010","call-number":"0008","author":[{"family":"Pearce","given":"Joshua M."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Sara J."},{"family":"Grant","given":"Gabriel B."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",8]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",6,20]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UF49VZJQ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UF49VZJQ","type":"article-journal","title":"Dissolved oxygen sensor based on fluorescence quenching of oxygen-sensitive ruthenium complexes immobilized in sol-gel-derived porous silica coatings","container-title":"The Analyst","page":"785-788","volume":"121","issue":"6","source":"RSC Publishing","abstract":"A dissolved oxygen sensor based on the quenching of fluorescence from a ruthenium dye complex entrapped in a porous sol-gel film is reported. Sol-gel-derived silica films were fabricated by dip-coating on to planar and optical fibre substrates. The films were pre-doped with the oxygen-sensitive ruthenium complex [RII-tris(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline)], the fluorescence of which is quenched in the presence of oxygen. The structure and behaviour of sol-gel films are dependent on the fabrication parameters. In particular, enhancement of the surface hydrophobicity increases the quenching response in water. This is achieved by using suitable proportions of modified precursors of silica of the form R(OEt)3Si, where R is an alkyl group, in the standard fabrication procedure. It is shown that by increasing the ratio of modified precursor, the quenching response in the aqueous phase increases. A very low limit of detection, 6 ppb, was determined for the modified films. Using a high-brightness blue LED, combined with a miniature photodiode detection system, these results indicate the potential for a low-cost, high-performance, portable dissolved oxygen sensor for use in many varied situations from aeration control to on-line river pollution monitoring.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/AN9962100785","journalAbbreviation":"Analyst","author":[{"family":"McEvoy","given":"Aisling K."},{"family":"McDonagh","given":"Colette M."},{"family":"MacCraith","given":"Brian D."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1996"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2009",8,23]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UFB76XVH","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UFB76XVH","type":"article-journal","title":"The Equity Illusion of Surface Ownership in Coalbed Methane Gas; The Rise of Mutual Simultaneous Rights in Mineral Law and The Resulting Need for Dispute Resolution in Split Estate Relations","container-title":"Mo.

But what do ecological economists mean by efficiency? In the resource use context, efficiency has a wide range of potential interpretations, from the ratio of work output/energy inputs to Pareto efficiency. Despite the potential richness of the efficiency concept, in practice, efficiency is often narrowly conceived within disciplinary boundaries. This appears to be the case even in ecological economics, which purports to be ‘transdisciplinary’ and pluralistic. Such narrow disciplinary perspectives essentially waste the richness of the efficiency concept. This wasting could mean ecological economists and decision-makers are destined to Sisyphean toil in the pursuit of sustainable development.\n\nThis paper explores the efficiency concept and its interpretation. It then reviews ecological economic literature to find that there is much room for improvement in the way ecological economists apply efficiency. Finally, the paper presents a framework within which a truly ecological economic approach to efficiency can emerge. Armed with this framework, policy makers and planners should be better prepared to make decisions leading to sustainable development.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800905004271","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.09.014","ISSN":"0921-8009","shortTitle":"Concepts of efficiency in ecological economics","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Economics","author":[{"family":"Jollands","given":"Nigel"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",3,15]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,8]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UMJSATAR","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UMJSATAR","type":"article-journal","title":"Groundwater Visualisation System (GVS): A software framework for integrated display and interrogation of conceptual hydrogeological models, data and time-series animation","container-title":"Journal of Hydrology","page":"56-72","volume":"491","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"Summary\nManagement of groundwater systems requires realistic conceptual hydrogeological models as a framework for numerical simulation modelling, but also for system understanding and communicating this to stakeholders and the broader community. To help overcome these challenges we developed GVS (Groundwater Visualisation System), a stand-alone desktop software package that uses interactive 3D visualisation and animation techniques. The goal was a user-friendly groundwater management tool that could support a range of existing real-world and pre-processed data, both surface and subsurface, including geology and various types of temporal hydrological information. GVS allows these data to be integrated into a single conceptual hydrogeological model. In addition, 3D geological models produced externally using other software packages, can readily be imported into GVS models, as can outputs of simulations (e.g. piezometric surfaces) produced by software such as MODFLOW or FEFLOW. Boreholes can be integrated, showing any down-hole data and properties, including screen information, intersected geology, water level data and water chemistry. Animation is used to display spatial and temporal changes, with time-series data such as rainfall, standing water levels and electrical conductivity, displaying dynamic processes. Time and space variations can be presented using a range of contouring and colour mapping techniques, in addition to interactive plots of time-series parameters. Other types of data, for example, demographics and cultural information, can also be readily incorporated. The GVS software can execute on a standard Windows or Linux-based PC with a minimum of 2 GB RAM, and the model output is easy and inexpensive to distribute, by download or via USB/DVD/CD.\n\nExample models are described here for three groundwater systems in Queensland, northeastern Australia: two unconfined alluvial groundwater systems with intensive irrigation, the Lockyer Valley and the upper Condamine Valley, and the Surat Basin, a large sedimentary basin of confined artesian aquifers. This latter example required more detail in the hydrostratigraphy, correlation of formations with drillholes and visualisation of simulation piezometric surfaces. Both alluvial system GVS models were developed during drought conditions to support government strategies to implement groundwater management. The Surat Basin model was industry sponsored research, for coal seam gas groundwater management and community information and consultation. The “virtual” groundwater systems in these 3D GVS models can be interactively interrogated by standard functions, plus production of 2D cross-sections, data selection from the 3D scene, rear end database and plot displays. A unique feature is that GVS allows investigation of time-series data across different display modes, both 2D and 3D. GVS has been used successfully as a tool to enhance community/stakeholder understanding and knowledge of groundwater systems and is of value for training and educational purposes. Projects completed confirm that GVS provides a powerful support to management and decision making, and as a tool for interpretation of groundwater system hydrological processes. A highly effective visualisation output is the production of short videos (e.g. 2–5 min) based on sequences of camera ‘fly-throughs’ and screen images. Further work involves developing support for multi-screen displays and touch-screen technologies, distributed rendering, gestural interaction systems. To highlight the visualisation and animation capability of the GVS software, links to related multimedia hosted online sites are included in the references.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169413002321","DOI":"10.1016/j.jhydrol.2013.03.023","ISSN":"0022-1694","shortTitle":"Groundwater Visualisation System (GVS)","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Hydrology","author":[{"family":"Cox","given":"Malcolm E."},{"family":"James","given":"Allan"},{"family":"Hawke","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Raiber","given":"Matthias"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,29]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UMUAJGMU","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UMUAJGMU","type":"book","title":"Leibniz on the Parallel Postulate and the Foundations of Geometry: The Unpublished Manuscripts","publisher":"Birkhäuser","number-of-pages":"199","source":"Google Books","abstract":"This book offers a general introduction to the geometrical studies of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) and his mathematical epistemology.

ECOLOGICAL ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ETHICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS FOR GLOBAL LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION","source":"dalspace.library.dal.ca","abstract":"Achieving environmental s¬ustainability in human organization is the defining challenge of the modern era. In light of the inability of the existing economic paradigm to provide for sustainability objectives, novel approaches to understanding and managing economic activities are required. Towards this end, the emergent field of ecological economics provides an alternative paradigm that expressly prioritizes the development of the theory and tools necessary to operationalize environmental sustainability in economic activity, which is viewed as prerequisite to sustainability in any other sphere. Here, I advance an internally consistent framework for understanding and implementing the core ecological economic sustainability criteria: appropriate scale relative to biocapacity; distributive justice; and efficient allocation. This framework includes: (1) an ecological communitarian conception of distributive justice which recognizes environmental sustainability as the first principle of distributive justice; (2) the rationale for biophysically-consistent ecological economic modeling of human activities as a basis for environmentally-enlightened policy and management; and (3) an appeal for scale-oriented environmental governance as could potentially be operationalized by a strong, centralized World Environment Organization.  I further apply this framework to evaluating the current and future status of livestock production systems at regional and global scales with respect to efficiency considerations as well as their relationships to sustainability boundary conditions for human activities as a whole. It is suggested that the current and projected scale of the livestock sector is fundamentally unsustainable, and that all leverage points must be exploited to rein in this sector in the interest of preventing irreversible ecological change. This must include, but cannot be limited to, strong eco-efficiency measures and changes in production technologies, species substitutions, and consumption patterns and volumes. Outcomes are interpreted in terms of their implications for environmental policy and governance oriented towards the sustainability objective.","URL":"http://DalSpace.library.dal.ca:8080/xmlui/handle/10222/12821","shortTitle":"WHAT’S AT STEAK?","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Pelletier","given":"Nathaniel L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",5,14]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,24]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UXJZMUJM","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/UXJZMUJM","type":"book","title":"Leibniz and the Environment","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"New York","number-of-pages":"256","source":"Amazon","event-place":"New York","abstract":"The work of seventeenth-century polymath Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz has proved inspirational to philosophers and scientists alike.

Drawing on Leibniz’s theory of soul-like, interconnected metaphysical entities he termed 'monads', Phemister explains how an individual’s true good is inextricably linked to the good of all. Phemister also finds in Leibniz’s works the rudiments of a theory of empathy and strategies for strengthening human feelings of compassion towards all living things.

In particular in the case of assessment of land planning scenarios, there is presently no consensual and widely adopted method although it is strongly required by the European Directive (2001/42/EC) on Strategic Environmental Assessment. However, different kinds of tools and methods are available such as human and environmental risk assessment, the ecological footprint, material flow analysis, substance flow analysis, physical input–output table, ecological network analysis, exergy, emergy or life cycle assessment. This review proposes a discussion on these tools and methods specifically applied to territories. After the meaning of territory is clarified, these approaches are presented and analyzed based on “key features” such as formalization, system modeling, inventoried flows, indicators provided and usability. This comparison highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each tool. It also emphasizes that the approach of life cycle assessment could provide a relevant framework for the environmental assessment of territories as it is the only method which can avoid burden shifting between life cycle stages, environmental impacts and territories.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147971200388X","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2012.07.024","ISSN":"0301-4797","shortTitle":"Environmental assessment of a territory","journalAbbreviation":"Journal of Environmental Management","author":[{"family":"Loiseau","given":"Eléonore"},{"family":"Junqua","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Roux","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Bellon-Maurel","given":"Véronique"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12,15]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,14]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/VFDNGMMM","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/VFDNGMMM","type":"article-journal","title":"Emergy analysis of emerging methods of fossil fuel production","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","collection-title":"Emergy Synthesis 8 ∼ Emergy and Environmental Accounting: Theories, Applications, and Methodologies","page":"57-68","volume":"315","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"The production of energy from unconventional sources of fossil fuels, (e.g., tar sands, shale or sandstone formations where oil or natural gas is tightly bound), is forming an increasingly large proportion of global energy use. This research evaluates three of the most prominent emerging methods of fossil fuel production—oil from oil/tar sands, shale oil and shale gas, both produced through hydraulic fracturing. In 2013, 42% of natural gas production and 41% of oil production in the United States was produced through hydraulic fracturing and ∼60% of new oil and gas wells use the method. In 2013, the Alberta region of Canada produced 1.7 million barrels per day of synthetic crude oil from oil sands, exporting 1.3 million barrels to the US every day, comprising ∼7% of daily US oil consumption. Results from this work show that natural gas obtained through hydraulic fracturing has an emergy yield ratio (EYR) between 4.23 and 9.18, depending on well productivity and whether the gas is “wet” (contains other hydrocarbons) or “dry” (pure or nearly pure methane). Synthetic crude oil from oil sands was found to have an EYR of 3.38–4.06 (in situ vs. mined production, respectively). The EYR of tight oil was found to be 3.43–4.73, dependent on the productivity of the well. Given the relatively high current market price of oil and relatively low market price of natural gas the observed results (i.e., similar or higher EYR for natural gas than past observations and a lower EYR for oil than past observations) are expected.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380014005547","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.10.036","ISSN":"0304-3800","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Campbell","given":"Elliott T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,8]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/VFQQKUM5","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/VFQQKUM5","type":"book","title":"Social influence.","publisher":"Thomson Brooks/Cole Publishing Co","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://doi.apa.org/psycinfo/1992-97487-000","author":[{"family":"Turner","given":"John C."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1991"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/VFT8CPIE","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/VFT8CPIE","type":"article-journal","title":"Assessing the sustainability of the UK society using thermodynamic concepts: Part 1","container-title":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","volume":"In Press, Uncorrected Proof","abstract":"This paper provides a concise overview of the influence of human activity within the UK society on resource consumption and the subsequent effects on the environment. The concept of the multi-scale integrated analysis of societal metabolism is applied to elucidate the evolution of the UK economy for the period between 1981 and 2004. Our findings highlight the transition to a service-based economy and the disproportionate increase of energy demand when compared to the overall population increase. Emergy synthesis is applied in order to understand the production and consumption patterns and the environmental support required to sustain human activity within the UK for the year 2004. Generally speaking the UK society greatly benefits from its significant natural resources with 44.3% of the total emergy used coming from home sources and 29.1% from locally renewable sources. Interestingly enough, despite its significant natural resources, the UK economy, seems to be a net emergy importer by 638.5�נ1021�seJ. Furthermore, the current economic activity is believed to have a significant impact in the environment despite the relatively low environmental load ratio of 2.44.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VMY-4SBYH7R-1/1/1b00e3c44e748fab14223f8e52d24e2d","DOI":"10.1016/j.rser.2008.03.004","call-number":"0002","shortTitle":"Assessing the sustainability of the UK society using thermodynamic concepts","author":[{"family":"Gasparatos","given":"Alexandros"},{"family":"El-Haram","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Horner","given":"Malcolm"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",5,11]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",5,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/VFZUT8DD","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/VFZUT8DD","type":"article-journal","title":"SQL databases v.

The general approach taken by the authors makes this an essential reference and handbook for professionals and students.","ISBN":"978-1-56670-253-9","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Muller","given":"Felix"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",2,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W3DACGSI","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W3DACGSI","type":"article-journal","title":"Resource quality, technological efficiency and factors of scale within the emergy framework: A response to Marco Raugei","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","page":"109-111","volume":"227","source":"ScienceDirect","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380011005862","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.12.004","ISSN":"0304-3800","shortTitle":"Resource quality, technological efficiency and factors of scale within the emergy framework","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Ulgiati","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Mark T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",2,24]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,30]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W3W95AH9","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W3W95AH9","type":"book","title":"Engines of Logic: Mathematicians and the Origin of the Computer","publisher":"WW Norton & Co., Inc.","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=601168","shortTitle":"Engines of Logic","author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Martin"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,5]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W4MV6S57","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W4MV6S57","type":"article-journal","title":"Cycling emergy: computing emergy in trophic networks","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","collection-title":"Emergy Synthesis 8 ∼ Emergy and Environmental Accounting: Theories, Applications, and Methodologies","page":"37-45","volume":"315","source":"ScienceDirect","abstract":"While cycles are a very important phenomena of ecosystems, they represent a methodological challenge in emergy accounting. The relevance of feedbacks is acknowledged in emergy evaluations, however they are not considered by the emergy algebra. In this paper, we present supporting arguments in favor of an update in the emergy accounting methodology. We argue that including the contribution of feedback emergy is essential to understand a system's internal functioning, thus studies interested in better capturing these features should consider emergy cycling. Feedbacks represent emergy that entered the system in the past (therefore it is not double counting), and they enable additional organization and work above that supported by input emergy alone.\n\nTo evaluate the effect upon system properties of including feedbacks, we compared two different methods for calculating transformities using trophic networks as case studies. One method followed the classic emergy rules where feedbacks were not included, and the other included the feedbacks (we refer to them as static and network method, respectively). The comparison between the resulting transformities and system emergy patterns showed that (1) transformities and system emergy were significantly higher with the network method, and (2) this increase affected the network compartments unevenly, altering their position in the emergy hierarchy. Estimating relative importance of the system's components or their true emergy requirements are only possible by evaluating the total emergy that flows through them.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380015000757","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.02.019","ISSN":"0304-3800","shortTitle":"Cycling emergy","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Modelling","author":[{"family":"Zarbá","given":"Lucía"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Mark T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",11,10]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",12,15]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W4SC3CDW","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W4SC3CDW","type":"book","title":"Matter and Form in Early Modern Science and Philosophy","publisher":"BRILL","number-of-pages":"259","source":"Google Books","abstract":"Matter and form have been fundamental principles in natural science since Greek Antiquity and their apparent rejection during the seventeenth century typically has been described as a precursor to the emergence of modern science.

The government has been trying to stop this land-use conversion and increase the area in rice-vegetable rotation. Important questions that must be answered to determine what strategy is best for society are, \"What is the reason behind this conversion?\"; \"Which system is more productive and which is more sustainable?\"; and \"How can economic policy be used to adjust the pattern of farmland use to attain sustainable development?\" To answer these questions, a combined evaluation of these agricultural production systems was done using emergy, energy and economic methods. An economic analysis clearly showed that the reason for this conversion was simply that the economic output/input ratio and the benefit density of the vegetable production system were greater than that of rice. However, both energy and emergy evaluations showed that long-term rice was the best choice for sustainable development, followed by rotation systems. The current price of rice is lower than the em-value of rice produced from the long-term rice system, but higher than that of rice produced from the rotation system. Scenario analysis showed that if the government increases the price of rice to the em-value of rice produced from the long-term rice system, US$0.4/kg, and takes the value of soil organic matter into account, the economic output/input ratios of both the rice and rotation systems will be higher than that of the vegetable system. The three methods, energy, emergy and economics, are different but complementary, each revealing a different aspect of the same system. Their combined use shows not only the reasons behind a system's current state or condition, but also the way to adjust these systems to move toward more sustainable states.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/science/article/B6WJ7-50RMPRR-5/2/49d431952717cb78ed48e6742786cd61","DOI":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.025","ISSN":"0301-4797","shortTitle":"Integrated emergy, energy and economic evaluation of rice and vegetable production systems in alluvial paddy fields","author":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Hongfang"},{"family":"Bai","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Hai"},{"family":"Campbell","given":"Daniel E."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2010",12,14]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W65VZ96M","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W65VZ96M","type":"article-journal","title":"Dam Risk Analysis Using Bayesian Networks","container-title":"Geohazards","URL":"http://dc.engconfintl.org/geohazards/10","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Marc"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",6,18]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W6QKTCEP","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/W6QKTCEP","type":"article-journal","title":"Reciprocal aspects of transient and steady-state concepts","container-title":"Electrical Engineering","page":"319-321","volume":"69","issue":"4","source":"IEEE Xplore","abstract":"IT IS well known that the transient response of a network can be specified completely in terms of its steady-state behavior and vice versa.

Various theoretical challenges were overcome in formulating the computational framework of DAMRAE and several new computational concepts were introduced. The concepts of Connectivity and Pedigree matrices are proposed to quantify the user-drawn event tree structures with proper accounting of interdependencies among the event tree branches. A generic calculation of Common-Cause Adjustment for the non-mutually exclusive failure modes is implemented along with introducing the new concepts of system response probability and consequence freezing. New output presentation formats such as cumulative risk estimate vs. initiating variable plots to analyze the increase of an incremental (annualized) risk estimate as a function of initiating variable are introduced. An additional consideration is given to the non-breach risk estimates in the risk modeling and new output formats such as non-breach F-N and F-$ charts are included as risk analysis outputs.\nDAMRAE, a Visual Basic.NET based framework, provides a convenient platform to structure the risk assessment of a dam in its existing state and for alternatives or various stages of implementing a risk reduction plan. The second chapter of the dissertation presents the architectural framework of DAMRAE and describes the underlying theoretical and computational logic employed in the software. An example risk assessment is presented in the third chapter to demonstrate the DAMRAE functionalities.\nIn the fourth chapter, the DAMRAE framework is extended into DAMRAE-U to incorporate uncertainty analysis functionality. Various aspects and requirements reviewed for uncertainty analysis in the context of dam safety risk assessment and theoretical challenges overcome to develop the computational framework for DAMRAE-U are described in this chapter. The capabilities of DAMRAE-U are illustrated in the fifth chapter, which contains an example dam safety risk assessment with uncertainty analysis. The dissertation concludes with a summary of DAMRAE features and recommendations for further work in the sixth chapter.","URL":"http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/docview/1347669301/abstract/3E542058AD4B4BFFPQ/1?accountid=14723","language":"English","author":[{"family":"Srivastava","given":"Anruag"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,20]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WAGT62P3","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WAGT62P3","type":"article-journal","title":"The emergence and use of diagramming in system dynamics: a critical account","container-title":"Systems Research and Behavioral Science","page":"3-23","volume":"25","issue":"1","abstract":"The paper reviews the leading diagramming methods employed in system dynamics to communicate the contents of models.

However, a decision to ban an agrochemical could also potentially have a negative impact on the value of ecosystem services, if resulting changes in crop management are damaging to ecosystems or result in negative socio-economic impacts. To support regulatory decision-making, consideration of ecosystem services to identify best environmental management options could be a way forward. There is generally a growing trend for the consideration of ecosystem services in decision making. Ecosystems provide the conditions for growing food, regulate water and provide wildlife habitats; these, amongst others, are known as ecosystem services.\n\nThe objectives of this case study were to bring a holistic approach to decision making by valuing the environmental, social and economic benefits derived from the use of chlorpyrifos in Valencian citrus production. Spanish growers harvest between 5 and 6 million t of citrus annually, worth an estimated €5 to 7 billion in food markets throughout Europe. The approach highlighted the potential for unintended negative consequences of regulatory decisions if the full context is not considered. In this study, rather than a regulatory restriction, the best option was the continued use of chlorpyrifos together with vegetated conservation patches as refuges for non-target insects. The conservation patches offset potential insecticidal impacts to insects whilst maintaining citrus production, farm income and the amenity value of the citrus landscape of Valencia. This was an initial proof-of-concept study and illustrates the importance of a wider perspective; other cases may have different outcomes depending on policies, the pesticide, crop scenarios, farm economics and the region.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969714014727","DOI":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.10.034","ISSN":"0048-9697","shortTitle":"Integrating ecosystem services into risk management decisions","journalAbbreviation":"Science of The Total Environment","author":[{"family":"Deacon","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Norman","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Nicolette","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Reub","given":"Gregory"},{"family":"Greene","given":"Gretchen"},{"family":"Osborn","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Andrews","given":"Paul"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,25]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WEK4HP3A","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WEK4HP3A","type":"article-journal","title":"Coal Seam Gas: Issues for Consideration in the Illawarra Region, NSW, Australia","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://ro.uow.edu.au/thsci/45/","shortTitle":"Coal Seam Gas","author":[{"family":"Stammers","given":"Joe"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",3,11]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WGFK2D6D","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WGFK2D6D","type":"paper-conference","title":"Hydroinformatics: Interoperability, standards and governance of water information infrastructures","container-title":"Proceedings of the WIRADA Science Symposium","page":"120–124","source":"Google Scholar","shortTitle":"Hydroinformatics","author":[{"family":"Denzer","given":"R."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WGVZ75PA","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WGVZ75PA","type":"book","title":"Systems Thinkers","publisher":"Springer","edition":"x, 316 p.","source":"Amazon.com","ISBN":"1-84882-524-2","author":[{"family":"Ramage","given":"Magnus"},{"family":"Shipp","given":"Karen"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9,18]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WHFENT6Z","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WHFENT6Z","type":"article-journal","title":"Emergy Evaluation of Formal Education in the United States: 1870 to 2011","container-title":"Systems","page":"328-365","volume":"2","issue":"3","source":"www.mdpi.com","abstract":"We evaluated the education system of the United States from 1870 to 2011 using emergy methods.

We calculated the emergy required to produce an individual with a given number of years of education by summing over the years of support needed to attain that level of education.

The emergy of teaching and learning per hour spent in this process was calculated as the sum of the emergy delivered by the education and experience of the teachers and the emergy brought to the process of learning by the students. The emergy of teaching and learning was about an order of magnitude larger than the annual emergy supporting the U.S. education system (i.e., the emergy inflows provided by the environment, energy and materials, teachers, entering students, goods and services).

Similar pulsing patterns were found in published data from many fields, and graphical analyses were made of published time series of plankton data of limnology and oceanography. Although the data appeared to be noisy and irregular, pulse amplitude was proportional to the time interval between pulses of similar size. Small-scale pulses were more frequent. Larger scale pulses delivered their effects in shorter time periods relative to their intervals. Such patterns may be explained as the result of simultaneous pulsing on several scales.                 After review of simulation models by other investigators, alternative systems designs were simulated including a single simple producer-consumer-recycle model and compound combinations. Designs which generated time series like those observed in many fields were analyzed for their energy characteristics.                 Simulation of the emergy (spelled with an \"m\"; the available energy of one kind required to make a product) flows and storages showed pulses to be high transformity, a hypothetical measure of feedback impact. Whereas the model with a single pulsing pair unit (e.g. consumer-resource unit) did not generate pulsing patterns when energy input was very low or very high, compound designs allowed excess input energy to be routed to the productivity of other pulsing units. The model with two producer-consumer-recycle units connected in parallel pulsed over a wide range of input energy levels and efficiencies. A hierarchy of pulses of different frequency was obtained when producer-consumer-recycle models were connected in series, with more frequent pulses in lower energy levels. The pulsing producer-consumer unit drew more power than a non-pulsing producer-consumer unit with similar calibrations. The theory that self-organization selects pulsing which increases performance of complex systems was compared with other theories for pulsing in various fields including economics and earth science.                 The pulsing paradigm explains fluctuations observed in systems as the concurrent dynamic pulsing on many scales.","URL":"http://search.proquest.com/docview/304425129?accountid=13552","note":"Ph.D.; University of Florida","author":[{"family":"Kang","given":"Daeseok"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WR5DTISQ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WR5DTISQ","type":"article-journal","title":"The Trade-Off between Risk and Control in Corporate Ownership","container-title":"Journal of Institutional and Theoretical Economics (JITE) / Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft","page":"252-274","volume":"160","issue":"2","source":"JSTOR","abstract":"This paper analyses the risk-control trade-off in corporate ownership.

We have previously shown that increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB), which can be detrimental to the central nervous system during neonatal life, induce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and glutamate by astrocytes. Nevertheless, the effect of UCB on microglia has never been investigated. Hence, the main goal of the present study was to evaluate whether UCB leads to microglial activation and to the release of the cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6. Additionally, we investigated the effects of UCB on glutamate efflux and cell death. The results showed that UCB induces morphological changes characteristic of activated microglia and the release of high levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, UCB triggered extracellular accumulation of glutamate and an increased cell death by apoptosis and necrosis. These results demonstrate, for the first time, that UCB is toxic to microglial cells and point to microglia as an important target of UCB in the central nervous system. Moreover, they suggest that UCB-induced cytokine production, by mediating cell injury, can further contribute to exacerbate neurototoxicity. Interestingly, microglia cells are much more responsive to UCB than astrocytes. Collectively, these data indicate that microglia may play an important role in the pathogenesis of encephalopathy during severe hyperbilirubinemia. � 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jnr.20857","DOI":"10.1002/jnr.20857","call-number":"0010","author":[{"family":"Gordo","given":"Ana C."},{"family":"Falc�o","given":"Ana S."},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Adelaide"},{"family":"Brito","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Silva","given":"Rui F.M."},{"family":"Brites","given":"Dora"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2009",6,10]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WZAKEVGB","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/WZAKEVGB","type":"article-journal","title":"Probability of second law violations in nonequilibrium steady states","container-title":"[[Physical Review Letters]]","page":"2401&ndash;2404","volume":"71","call-number":"0000","author":[{"family":"Denis J.

These goals are commonly identified by examining the vested interests of the various social groups that are stakeholders in a region. However, knowledge about what people value represents only part of the information needed to identify comprehensive assessment goals for environmental systems that include both economic and ecological components and processes. All parties also need to understand what is valuable to ecosystems because that determines the ecological patterns and processes that prevail in the long run. The competition among alternate system designs for available energy determines the viability of the choices that people make for their environment. Ecosystems that prevail in competition use the process of self-organization to create system designs that maximize the use of ever-changing sources of available energy. The efficacy of ecosystem designs can be evaluated using the maximum empower principle, which states that ecosystems evolve toward designs that maximize empower (emergy use per unit time). Emergy is an accounting quantity that normalizes the different kinds of energy developed in a system so that they may be compared. The counter-intuitive and sometimes controversial results that come from emergy analyses are illustrated by examining three environmental problems on the interface between ecology and economics. A process for identifying and using social and ecosystem values to guide environmental assessments is proposed using a conceptual energy systems model that shows how these processes might interact within a region. The probability of realizing a given change in system empower production is suggested as a decision criterion that can be used by managers to evaluate the efficacy of alternatives.","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es001818n","DOI":"10.1021/es001818n","ISSN":"0013-936X","journalAbbreviation":"Environ.

The study is inspired by other studies of the emergence of new research areas done by sociologists and historians of science, and includes both cognitive and social aspects, macro trends and the role of individuals. The basis for the paper is a combination of literature studies and interviews with key researchers from the field. The story opens with the emergence of the new environmental agenda in the 1960s, which was influenced by the scientific development in biology and ecology. Then it is outlined how the environmental challenge was met by economics in the 1960s. Around 1970, the basic ideas of ecological economics were given modern formulations, but it took a long gestation period from the beginning of the 1970s to the end of the 1980s, before ecological economics took shape. During this gestation period, the personal relationships between the actors were formed, and the meetings that were decisive for the formal establishment of ecological economics took place.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800904002058","DOI":"10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.02.012","ISSN":"0921-8009","journalAbbreviation":"Ecological Economics","author":[{"family":"Røpke","given":"Inge"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",10,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",2,8]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/X6E48WVQ","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/X6E48WVQ","type":"article","title":"Coal Seam Gas Regulatory Review - Fact Sheet","publisher":"Queensland Competition Authority","URL":"http://www.qca.org.au/getattachment/44349536-31a6-4502-ace6-1967bf53a326/Fact-Sheet.aspx","author":[{"family":"QCA","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,12]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/X7Z3E6CT","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/X7Z3E6CT","type":"book","title":"Invisible cities","publisher":"Vintage","publisher-place":"London","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-0-7493-9764-7","call-number":"0497","author":[{"family":"Calvino","given":"Italo"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/X86VKMQD","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/X86VKMQD","type":"article-journal","title":"Using Dynamic Modeling to Scope Environmental Problems and Build Consensus","container-title":"Environmental Management","page":"183-195","volume":"22","issue":"2","source":"link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au","URL":"http://link.springer.com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/article/10.1007/s002679900095","DOI":"10.1007/s002679900095","ISSN":"0364-152X, 1432-1009","journalAbbreviation":"Environmental Management","language":"en","author":[{"family":"Costanza","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Ruth","given":"Matthias"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",3]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",10,25]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/X9467KZI","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/X9467KZI","type":"book","title":"The evolution of physics : from early concepts to relativity and quanta","publisher":"Simon and Schuster","publisher-place":"New York","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-671-20156-2","call-number":"0147","author":[{"family":"Einstein","given":"Albert"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1966"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/X9SWKG4Q","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/X9SWKG4Q","type":"article-journal","title":"Energy Analysis for Environmental Impact Assessment","container-title":"Journal of the Water Resources Planning and Management Division","page":"451–466","volume":"106","issue":"2","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"F.C."},{"family":"Kangas","given":"P.C."},{"family":"Odum","given":"H.T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1980"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XADZW2JE","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XADZW2JE","type":"article-journal","title":"Systems Chemistry: Kinetic and Computational Analysis of a Nearly Exponential Organic Replicator13","container-title":"Angewandte Chemie","page":"6908-6913","volume":"117","issue":"41","abstract":"No Abstract","URL":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ange.200501527","DOI":"10.1002/ange.200501527","call-number":"0000","shortTitle":"Systems Chemistry","author":[{"family":"Kindermann","given":"Maik"},{"family":"Stahl","given":"Insa"},{"family":"Reimold","given":"Malte"},{"family":"Pankau","given":"Wolf Matthias"},{"family":"Kiedrowski","given":"G�nter","dropping-particle":"von"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",8,20]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XBQCW9TA","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XBQCW9TA","type":"article-journal","title":"The Analog Computer as an Aid to Stream Self-Purification Computations","container-title":"Journal (Water Pollution Control Federation)","page":"951–962","volume":"35","issue":"8","source":"Google Scholar","author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"J.

For example, there are concerns regarding chlorofluorocarbons and their impact on stratospheric ozone, radon and its effect on human health, coal mining and effects on habitat loss, as well as numerous other issues. However, these issues do not exist in a vacuum nor occur just one at a time. There is a need to assess social and ecological risks comprehensively and account for numerous, inter-related potential risks. Given limited funds available for addressing these issues, how can spending for purposes of environmental and ecological mitigation be optimized? What is the magnitude of overall ecological risk for a given region? Novel software, the “Ecological Risk-o-Meter”, addresses these questions and concerns. The software tool not only assesses the current environmental and ecological risks, but also takes into account potential solutions and provides guidance as to how spending can be optimized to reducing overall environmental risk. We demonstrate this new tool and show how to optimize the costs of risk reduction in recursive cycles based on feedbacks.

As a result, optimal performance of the apparatus is frequently not obtained, although it can be adapted to a wide range of fluorescence measurements including corrected excitation and emission spectra, quantum yields, polarization of fluorescence, as well as simple measurements of fluorescence intensity. Increasing interest in emission spectroscopy in recent years has generated a demand for more sophistication in the use of instruments for measuring fluorescence. Fortunately, coincident with these requirements, there have been marked improvements in the stability of lamp sources and in the quality of optical components. It does not seem unreasonable, therefore, that commercially available fluorescence spectrometers may be used for purposes other than the simple measurements for which they were originally intended. The present paper discusses some practical aspects of the use of the Aminco-Bowman spectrophotofluorometer for accurate measurement of spectra in the hope that such a communication will be helpful to those who wish to extend the usefulness of the instrument.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6W9V-4DYN465-9K/2/9c7928770406b999aa5efebd09b58824","DOI":"10.1016/0003-2697(67)90040-1","call-number":"0074","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Raymond F."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1967",8]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",8,17]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XTHMVGRS","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XTHMVGRS","type":"book","title":"Ecological Microcosms","publisher":"Springer","ISBN":"0-387-97980-8","call-number":"0123","author":[{"family":"Beyers","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",8]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XTNTPE52","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XTNTPE52","type":"article-journal","title":"Mathematics for generative processes: Living and non-living systems","container-title":"Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics","page":"324-340","volume":"189","issue":"1-2","abstract":"The traditional Differential Calculus often shows its limits when describing living systems. These in fact present such a richness of characteristics that are, in the majority of cases, much wider than the description capabilities of the usual differential equations. Such an aspect became particularly evident during the research (completed in 2001) for an appropriate formulation of Odum's Maximum Em-Power Principle (proposed by the Author as a possible Fourth Thermodynamic Principle). In fact, in such a context, the particular non-conservative Algebra, adopted to account for both Quality and quantity of generative processes, suggested we introduce a faithfully corresponding concept of “derivative” (of both integer and fractional order) to describe dynamic conditions however variable. The new concept not only succeeded in pointing out the corresponding differential bases of all the rules of Emergy Algebra, but also represented the preferential guide in order to recognize the most profound physical nature of the basic processes which mostly characterize self-organizing Systems (co-production, co-injection, inter-action, feed-back, splits, etc.). From a mathematical point of view, the most important novelties introduced by such a new approach are: (i) the derivative of any integer or fractional order can be obtained independently from the evaluation of its lower order derivatives; (ii) the exponential function plays an extremely hinge role, much more marked than in the case of traditional differential equations; (iii) wide classes of differential equations, traditionally considered as being non-linear, become “intrinsically” linear when reconsidered in terms of “incipient” derivatives; (iv) their corresponding explicit solutions can be given in terms of new classes of functions (such as “binary” and “duet” functions); (v) every solution shows a sort of “persistence of form” when representing the product generated with respect to the agents of the generating process; (iv) and, at the same time, an intrinsic “genetic” ordinality which reflects the fact that any product “generated” is something more than the sum of the generating elements. Consequently all these properties enable us to follow the evolution of the “product” of any generative process from the very beginning, in its “rising”, in its “incipient” act of being born. This is why the new “operator” introduced, specifically apt when describing the above-mentioned aspects, was termed as “incipient” (or “spring”) derivative. In addition, even if the considered approach was suggested by the analysis of self-organizing living Systems, some specific examples of non-living Systems will also be mentioned. In fact, what is much more surprising is that such an approach is even more valid (than the traditional one) to describe non-living Systems too. In fact the resulting “drift” between traditional solutions and “incipient” solutions led us to reconsider the phenomenon of Mercury's precessions. The satisfactory agreement with the astronomical data suggested, as a consequential hypothesis, a different interpretation of its physical origin, substantially based on the Maximum Em-Power Principle.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6TYH-4G2BG86-3&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=29d9619caf8de13561610d2f86d7eeb0","DOI":"10.1016/j.cam.2005.03.032","call-number":"0003","shortTitle":"Mathematics for generative processes","author":[{"family":"Giannantoni","given":"Corrado"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",5,1]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2008",3,20]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XUIWZBTW","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XUIWZBTW","type":"book","title":"Ecological and General Systems: An Introduction to Systems Ecology","publisher":"University Press of Colorado","edition":"Rev Sub","ISBN":"0-87081-320-X","call-number":"0115","shortTitle":"Ecological and General Systems","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",4]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XUN554GE","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/XUN554GE","type":"article-journal","title":"Self-Reporting and Self-Monitoring Requirements under Environmental Law","container-title":"Envtl.

Three biological species, i.e. water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica), loach (Misgurus anguillicaudatus) and a pseudomonad (Rhodopseudomonas palustris), were combined in different ways: (A) water spinach–loach–pseudomonad; (B) water spinach–loach; (C) water spinach–pseudomonad, to construct three ecological engineering systems targeted at removing nutrients from the eutrophic water of Taihu Lake, PR China. An integrated water quality, emergy and economic evaluation of the three treatment systems was performed based on the observed changes in biomass, water quality, and other natural and economic inputs and outputs. The three ecological engineering treatment systems showed a different order of efficiency in removing nutrients (treatment A &gt; B &gt; C), produced different environmental loadings at the foreground (treatment B &gt; C &gt; A), background (treatment C = A &gt; B) and whole system scales (treatment C &gt; A &gt; B), and had different economic feasibility (treatment B &gt; A &gt; C). Finally, after taking all direct and indirect environmental and economic impacts into account, treatment A was found to be the best choice at the foreground scale, followed by treatment C and then B, while at the background and whole system scales, treatment B was the best option followed by A and C. In this analysis, emergy evaluation was found to be an ideal ecological integration tool for quantifying both the environmental and economic characteristics of ecological engineering systems and processes at multiple scales, including pollution treatment systems.

This was the experience that informed his Protogaea (1691), or history of the earth. (The first English translation of the work, which I did together with Claudine Cohen, appeared in 2008.) Drawing on archival documents from Clausthal and Hannover my book tells the story of Leibniz's invention, his struggles to establish it, and the ultimate failure of the venture.\n\nDuring the research phase of the project (while I was based at the MPIWG in Berlin, 2012-13), I reconstructed a detailed narrative of Leibniz’s efforts during the years 1679-1682. It was during this period that he (1) assumed control over the wind machine that he claimed to have invented, and (2) attempted to seize rights, patents and future earnings from that invention. He had a rival at that time, the Dutch-Japanese inventor Pieter Hartsinck. Until now, nobody has appreciated the role that Hartsinck’s original invention played in the story about Leibniz’s venture. The final version of my manuscript details the history of the years 1679-1686, when Leibniz became most involved in developing his machine. More than that, it also explores the subsequent history during which editors of the Leibniz Edition shaped the narrative, and largely erased Hartsinck from the picture. My book connects Leibniz’s failed entrepreneurship to larger questions about history, enlightenment and industrialization. I explore the notion of narrative repetition. Why do we keep repeating the same stories about the same figures, even when there is evidence that suggests we are wrong to do so?","URL":"https://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/en/research/projects/deptii_wakefield_leibniz","author":[{"family":"Wakefield","given":"Andre"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,14]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,14]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/Z8IKHJ7D","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/Z8IKHJ7D","type":"article-journal","title":"Dynamic emergy accounting for assessing the environmental benefits of subtropical wetland stormwater management systems","container-title":"Ecological Modelling","page":"327–361","volume":"192","issue":"3","source":"Google Scholar","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380005003728","author":[{"family":"Tilley","given":"David Rogers"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Mark T."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"accessed":{"date-parts":[["2015",9,24]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ZAI9SM82","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ZAI9SM82","type":"book","title":"Energy system of New Zealand and the use of embodied energy for evaluating benefits of international trade","publisher":"Joint Centre for Environmental Sciences, University of Canterbury","call-number":"0007","author":[{"family":"Odum","given":"Howard T"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["1980"]]}}},{"key":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ZDT534GV","type":"put","valueEncoding":"json","value":{"id":"http://zotero.org/users/39885/items/ZDT534GV","type":"paper-conference","title":"Emergy simulator, an open source simulation platform dedicated to systems ecology and emergy studies","container-title":"Proceedings of the IV International Biennial Workshop Advances in Energy Studies.

The analysis employs the conceptual tools of energy quality, embodied energy, and energy amplifer effect. A simple land-use model representative of the major land-use systems is formulated. The theory of selection for maximum power is applied and coupled with linear programming techniques to suggest an optimal method determining best use of water for combined economics of humanity and nature. The objective function is structured in terms of the total energy productivity of all the subsystems. The maximum power principle is employed as a more inclusive criterion than the usual profit or utility maximization.

However, independent theoretical and applied studies, which suggested the maximization of the entropy production during nonequilibrium processes (the so-called maximum entropy production principle, MEPP), appeared in the 20th century. Publications on this topic were fragmented and different research teams, which were concerned with this principle, were unaware of studies performed by other scientists. As a result, the recognition and the use of MEPP by a wider circle of researchers were considerably delayed. The objectives of the present review consist in summation and analysis of studies dealing with MEPP. The first part of the review is concerned with the thermodynamic and statistical basis of the principle (including the relationship of MEPP with the second law of thermodynamics and Prigogine's principle). Various existing applications of the principle to analysis of nonequilibrium systems will be discussed in the second part.","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157305004813","DOI":"10.1016/j.physrep.2005.12.001","ISSN":"0370-1573","journalAbbreviation":"Physics Reports","author":[{"family":"Martyushev","given":"L.
